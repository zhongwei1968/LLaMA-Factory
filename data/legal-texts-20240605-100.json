        "text": "In the singapore international commercial court\nof the republic of singapore\n[2024] SGHC(I) 7\nSuit No 4 of 2017 (Summons No 59 of 2023)\nBetween\nKiri Industries Ltd\n... Plaintiff\nAnd\nSenda International Capital Ltd\nDyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n... Defendants\njudgment\n[Civil Procedure - Judgments and orders]\n[Civil Procedure - Service]\n1 When a judgment debtor does not pay the judgment creditor, it is open to the judgment creditor to obtain an order for examination of the judgment debtor on its property and for production of documents relevant to the questions. If the judgment debtor is a company, the order is directed to an officer or officers of the company.\n2 An examination order was made against a company and two of its officers. The two officers are not party to the litigation, and are foreign nationals resident out of the jurisdiction. Leave to serve the examination order on both officers out of the jurisdiction was granted, and it was served on one of the officers by substituted service. In this application, the company and that officer challenge each of the examination order itself, the order giving leave to serve the officer out of the jurisdiction, and the order for substituted service. Their submissions raise questions as to when the Court can assert the compulsive examination power over an officer not party to the litigation and located out of the jurisdiction, and with what limitations, including having regard to infringement of the sovereignty of the country where the officer is resident.\n3 For the reasons which follow, the examination order was validly made and stands, but the order giving leave to serve the applicant officer out of the jurisdiction should be set aside. The other officer is in the same position, and the leave to serve him out of the jurisdiction should also be set aside, subject to liberty to apply in that respect. Since the order giving leave to serve the applicant officer out of the jurisdiction is set aside, the order for substituted service of that officer should also be set aside, and it would have been set aside in any event.\nBackground\n4 Kiri Industries Ltd (\"Kiri\") and Senda International Capital Ltd (\"Senda\") became joint venturers in DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd (\"DyStar\"). Kiri, a company incorporated and listed in India, held 37.57% of the shareholding in DyStar; Senda, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, held 62.43% of the shareholding. Senda is a wholly owned subsidiary of a company incorporated and listed in the People's Republic of China (\"China\", and the adjective \"Chinese\"), Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co, Ltd (\"Longsheng\"). One share was held by Well Prospering Ltd, another wholly owned subsidiary of Longsheng. DyStar carried on business in the dye industry, in which each of Kiri and Longsheng were already established players.\n5 The relationship between Kiri and Longsheng broke down. In 2017, Kiri brought proceedings against Senda for oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Senda counterclaimed against Kiri and officers of Kiri on a number of causes of action, and DyStar brought proceedings against Kiri and the officers mirroring those claims and with some additional claims.\n6 The litigation was prolonged and hard fought. Senda and DyStar had some limited success in their counterclaims and claims, but in the major contest concerning oppression Kiri prevailed. A buy-out order was made that Senda purchase Kiri's shareholding in DyStar based on a valuation to be assessed (see DyStarGlobal Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd and others and another suit [2018] 5 SLR 1). The subsequent valuation process was complex and lengthy, but ultimately a buy-out price of US$ 603.8 million was ordered: the final valuation judgment was issued on 3 March 2023 (see Kiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another[2023] SGHC(I) 4). There were many first instance hearings, a number of judgments and more than one appeal in the course of the litigation.\n7 Significant costs were incurred, and a number of costs orders were made. After set-off, including taking account of a payment by Senda to DyStar on Kiri's behalf, Senda is liable to Kiri in the amount of S$6,669,612.55 (excluding interest).\n8 There was extensive correspondence in arriving at the costs amount. A tripartite agreement was entered into the effect of which was that Senda would pay the amount to DyStar on Kiri's behalf and would pay to Kiri in mid-December 2022 the costs amount as then ascertained (it was later slightly increased by a further costs order). Senda declined to pay on the ground that the amount of the payment by Senda to DyStar was yet to be finally ascertained or agreed. It does not now dispute its liability to Kiri in the above amount. But it still has not paid the costs. In this application, it says that it does not have the means to do so.\n9 In February 2023, Kiri filed two Writs of Seizure and Sale, pursuant to which a number of shares in DyStar belonging to Senda were seized to satisfy the cost liability. Senda alleged \"irregularities\" in the writs, but did not seek to stay or otherwise challenge them. Kiri, however, did not further prosecute the sale of the shares, and the writs have now expired.\n10 In July 2023, Kiri obtained an order that Senda be examined by its director, Ms Fan Jing (\"Ms Fan\"), and its former director, Mr Ruan Weixiang (\"Mr Ruan\"), as to its means to satisfy the costs orders (\"the EJD order\"). Mr Ruan was Senda's sole director throughout the oppression and associated litigation until he resigned on 2 March 2023; he was and remains Managing Director of Longsheng and Chairman of the board of DyStar. Ms Fan became Senda's sole director on 2 March 2023 in succession to Mr Ruan.\n11 Ms Fan and Mr Ruan are both Chinese nationals. At all material times Mr Ruan was and is resident in China. On the evidence before me, at all material times Ms Fan was and is resident in China; an issue is whether Kiri should have known that she was resident in China.\n12 In September 2023, Kiri obtained an order giving leave to serve the EJD order on Senda and Ms Fan in Hong Kong and on Mr Ruan in China (\"the service out order\"). Senda was served at its registered office. Ms Fan could not be served in Hong Kong, and in October 2023 Kiri obtained an order for substituted service of the EJD order on her (\"the substituted service order\"). Service was carried out in accordance with the substituted service order.\n13 Service has not been effected on Mr Ruan. As later described, Kiri accepts that he must be served with the judicial assistance of the Chinese Courts pursuant to the Treaty on Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Singapore concluded in 1999 (\"the Treaty\"), and has set the necessary process in train, but service has not yet occurred.\n14 Kiri's efforts to enforce Senda's costs liability are not the only continuation of the underlying litigation. Senda did not carry out the purchase of Kiri's shareholding in DyStar. In July 2023 Kiri applied in SIC/SUM 24/2023 (\"SUM 24\") for alternative relief in respect of the buy-out order, and in default a winding-up of DyStar. SUM 24 was heard on 24-25 January 2024, and at the time of hearing this application no decision had been issued.\nThis Application\n15 SIC/SUM 59/2023 (\"the application\") is an application by Senda and Ms Fan (together, \"the Applicants\"). In the application they ask that the EJD order be set aside, or alternatively varied by requiring compliance with Chinese law and procedures; that the service out order be set aside; that the substituted service order be set aside; and as a last resort that the examination hearing not occur until after SUM 24 has been finally disposed of, including any appeal.\n16 The prayers in the application ask that the orders be set aside or varied or the hearing be postponed, without limitation to the orders or the hearing so far as they concern Ms Fan. The Applicants' submissions at times were made as if Mr Ruan was an applicant and the EJD order and the service out order should also be set aside so far as they concerned him. Mr Ruan is not an applicant, plainly deliberately so, and it is necessary to confine the result in the application to the positions of Senda and Ms Fan. Mr Sanjiv Rajan (\"Mr Rajan\"), leading counsel for Kiri, nonetheless accepted that if the reason for setting the EJD order aside applied equally in relation to Mr Ruan, the order should also be set aside as against him, and it must be the same for the service out order; see R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd v National Westminster Bank Ltd [1978] QB 146 in relation to the discharge of an injunction. Mr Toh Kian Sing SC (\"Mr Toh\"), leading counsel for the Applicants, invited that course.\n17 The orders were all made exparte . It was common ground that the application invoked the power in O 32 r 6 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (\"the ROC\") to set aside an order obtained exparte , and as well the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. An application to set aside an exparte order is not an appeal, and the order may be set aside if the court finds that it was made under a misapprehension upon new matters being put before it: see Tay Long Kee Impex Pte Ltdv Tan Beng Huwah (trading as Sin Kwang Wah) [2000] 1 SLR(R) 786 at [19], where the Court of Appeal stated, in relation to the discharge of an exparte injunction, that \"[the judge] is to determine whether on the full facts and arguments presented by both parties before him, the injunction should be continued or discharged or a fresh injunction issued\".\nAn Adjournment Application\n18 I have referred to the prayer in the application that the examination hearing not take place until after SUM 24 has been finally disposed of, including any appeal. In the Applicants' written submissions, filed a few days before the hearing, it was submitted not only that the examination hearing should be adjourned (the language used was also that it should be stayed) until after the decision in SUM 24 was known, but also that this application should be adjourned pending the decision in SUM 24. It was submitted that this should be done in the exercise of the Court's case management powers, with reference to CIMC Raffles Offshore (Singapore) PTS Ltd v Schahin Holding SA[2014] EWHC 1742 (Comm) (\" CIMC \"). In that case an order similar to the EJD order was set aside on the principal ground that the United Kingdom courts did not have jurisdiction to make the order against the foreign officer of the corporate judgment debtor, but Justice Sir Richard Field commented that in any event he would have exercised his discretion to direct that the officer's attendance be postponed to \"take account of the parallel steps that are being taken to enforce the judgment against [the] judgment debtor\": CIMC at [26].\n19 At the hearing, Mr Toh did not begin by applying for an adjournment. He was well into his substantive submissions when attention was drawn to the written submissions and he was asked whether the request for an adjournment was maintained. It was, and Mr Toh made his submissions in that respect. I declined to adjourn the application, and should give my reasons for doing so.\n20 The application was filed in early December 2023. It was supported by a lengthy affidavit of Ms Fan and an affidavit of Mr Wang Lingqi (\"Mr Wang\") providing an expert opinion on Chinese law. The hearing date was fixed. Pursuant to directions, responsive affidavits of Mr Manish Pravinchandra Kiri (\"Mr Kiri\") and Dr Arthur Xiao Dong (\"Dr Dong\") were filed, the latter also providing an expert opinion on Chinese law. Second affidavits of Ms Fan and Mr Wang were filed in reply, and then another affidavit of Mr Kiri. Nearly 3000 pages of materials were generated. Also pursuant to directions, written submissions were exchanged accompanied by numerous authorities. As earlier noted, the submission of an adjournment appeared in the Applicants' written submissions.\n21 As an exercise in proper use of resources, adjournment of the application had little if anything to commend it. The preparation had been done, including the obtaining of expert opinions on Chinese law; the costs had been incurred; while the Applicants had invited Kiri to agree to an adjournment, which Kiri had declined to do, the Applicants had not applied for the question of adjournment to be considered ahead of the hearing, and the teams of counsel were gathered in the courtroom and ready to proceed. Adjournment of the application would bring considerable waste.\n22 Nor in my view was there substance in Mr Toh's argument for an adjournment. It rested on proposals (not necessarily the only ones on the table) for alternative relief in SUM 24. In SUM 24, Senda contended that it was unable to carry out the buy-out order because it did not have and could not raise the necessary funds. Mr Toh referred to its proposal that funds available in DyStar be used to declare a dividend of US$100m to Kiri and Senda, US$62.43m to Senda, from which Senda would pay US$55.95m to Kiri as compensation for the oppressive acts and pay all the costs, followed by an enbloc sale of DyStar's shares and pro rata distribution according to shareholding. He referred then to Kiri's proposal of a two-stage alternative of purchase by DyStar, not Senda, of Kiri's shares valued at US$100m using the DyStar funds, followed by an enbloc sale of the remainder of the DyStar shares and distribution with priority to Kiri's entitlement to the balance of the buy-out price of US$503.8m and to the costs. In either case, he said, Kiri would receive the costs; the examination of Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) was therefore not necessary and it was not necessary to decide this application. The Applicants supported this argument by suggesting that, in not further prosecuting the Writs of Seizure and Sale, Kiri had shown that it was prepared to wait for the alternative relief in SUM 24.\n23 At the time of the hearing of the application, which of the proposals in SUM 24 might find favour with the Court, if one of them at all, was not known. From the debate in the course of the hearing of SUM 24, if the Kiri proposal were adopted it was likely to be well over a year before the enbloc sale process was completed, and its outcome could not be guaranteed. The costs had been outstanding, subject to the later slight increase, for over a year. I considered that Kiri was entitled to progress its recovery of the costs without exposure to having to wait another year or more without certainty of earlier recovery or recovery in a year or more. As to the Writs of Seizure and Sale, I did not think contentment could be read into the failure further to prosecute them. In correspondence to the Court, Kiri requested that the writs be held in abeyance because the sale of the seized shares could be superseded by an enbloc sale or a winding up of DyStar. It was understandable that Kiri did not take them further; sale of the seized DyStar shares would bring in another shareholder and possibly impede the enbloc sale then under contemplation, and possibly reduce the pot of money from which Kiri hoped to obtain the buy-out price. The failure to progress the sale of the seized shares was not because Kiri was content to wait.\n24 Given the stage at which the question of adjournment was raised, a strong case for adjournment of the application in the exercise of the case management power was required. In my view, there was nothing like a strong case, and the proper course was to hear and decide the application, so that either it was known now that one or more of the orders was lost, or Kiri could continue with the examination of Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) towards recovery of the costs.\n25 I add that orders were made in SUM 24 shortly after the hearing of the application. They did not take up either of the proposals to which Mr Toh referred. The orders were for an enbloc sale of the shares in DyStar, with a procedure to determine a long-stop date for entry into a binding sale agreement; the timing was indeterminate. There was no reason to revisit the question of adjournment.\nOverview of the Applicants' Contentions\n26 The Applicants contended that the EJD order and the service out order should be set aside or varied on the grounds that (a) Ms Fan and Mr Ruan were not closely connected with the substantive claim which was the subject of the EJD order, in the Applicants' submission that claim being the costs liability under the costs orders made in the underlying litigation; (b) Ms Fan and Mr Ruan were both located in China, and the EJD order and compliance with it contravened Chinese law; and (c) there were other ways for Kiri to obtain the information sought under the EJD order which would not infringe Chinese sovereignty (that is, by judicial assistance under the Treaty). Further or alternatively, they contended that the EJD order and the service out order should be set aside for failure by Kiri to fulfil its duty of full and frank disclosure when it obtained the orders on an exparte basis. As to the substituted service order, they contended that it should be set aside because the mode of service was contrary to Chinese law; further or alternatively, because Kiri had failed to provide full and frank disclosure of material facts when applying for the order on an exparte basis.\n27 These contentions in the written submissions lumped Ms Fan and Mr Ruan together, as if Mr Ruan was an applicant; he is not, and is not necessarily in the same position as Ms Fan, and this must be remembered when coming to the Applicants' submissions in more detail. They also lumped together setting aside or varying the EJD order and setting aside the service out order, treating the grounds as applying equally in both cases. As will be explained, that is not so: it is at the stage of the service out order that the grounds require consideration.\nThe EJD Order\nThe making of the order\n28 By O 48 r 1(1) of the ROC, and confining its effect to a corporate judgment debtor, on an application made by exparte summons supported by an affidavit in Form 99, the Court may order an officer of a corporate judgment debtor to attend before the Registrar and be orally examined on whatever property the judgment debtor has and wheresoever situated, and to produce books or documents in the possession of the judgment debtor relevant to the questions. By r 1(2), the order must be in Form 100 and must be served personally on the judgment debtor and on any officer of a body corporate ordered to attend for examination.\n29 By the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2013 in force at the time (\"the Practice Directions\"), a questionnaire must be annexed to the examination order when it is served on the officer; the form of the questionnaire is prescribed, but the questions may be modified. At the hearing, the answered questionnaire is to be produced to the Registrar and received as evidence upon confirmation on oath that the answers provided are true and correct. The judgment creditor may then apply to discharge the officer or proceed with further questioning. The officer need not attend the hearing if the answered questionnaire, verified by affidavit or statutory declaration, is provided to the judgment creditor before the hearing and the judgment creditor agrees to apply for a discharge of the examination order at the hearing.\n30 Kiri applied for the EJD order by an exparte summons in SIC/SUM 21/2023 filed on 10 July 2023. Following the structure of Form 100, it asked for orders that Senda by its director Ms Fan, for whom a Chinese identification number and a Hong Kong address (\"the Hong Kong address\") were given, and Mr Ruan its former director, for whom a Chinese identification number and an address in China were given, attend before the Registrar on a date to be fixed and be orally examined as to whether Senda has any property or means of satisfying the cost orders against it and whether any and what debts are owing to Senda, and produce any books or documents in Senda's possession or power relating to those questions. The Hong Kong address was the address of Senda's registered office.\n31 The application was supported by an affidavit of Mr Kiri. Form 99 referred to in O 48 r 1(1) is relatively formal: the deponent identifies the judgment debt, says that it is unsatisfied, says that \"it is desired to examine the judgment debtor (or an officer of the judgment debtor company) on the question whether any and if so what debts are owing to him (or the judgment debtor company) and/or means of satisfying the judgment debt\", and asks for an order for attendance and production of documents. Mr Kiri's affidavit was lengthy, but effectively followed that form.\n32 The EJD order was made by an Assistant Registrar on 14 July 2023, in the terms as asked. It was endorsed with a notice that if Senda neglected to obey the order, Ms Fan and Mr Ruan would \"each be liable to process of execution for the purpose of compelling the said Senda International Capital Ltd to obey the same\". In accordance with the Practice Directions, it was accompanied by questionnaires for each of Ms Fan and Mr Ruan setting out questions to be answered and documents to be produced, the completed questionnaires and the documents to be brought to the hearing. Notes to the questionnaires included that they were required to attend the hearing unless they obtained Kiri's consent to dispense with their attendance or discharge the order, and the warning that if they failed to attend the hearing, Kiri may commence committal proceedings against them for that failure with a penalty that may be imposed of fine and/or imprisonment.\nSetting the scene: Burgundy Global\n33 In Burgundy Global Exploration Corp v Transocean Offshore International Ventures Ltd and another appeal [2014] 3 SLR 381 (\" BurgundyGlobal \"), Transocean entered judgment against Burgundy Global, and applied for and obtained EJD orders against directors of Burgundy Global all of whom were foreign nationals ordinarily resident in the Philippines. After unsuccessful attempts to serve the orders on the directors in the Philippines, Transocean obtained an order for substituted service by service on Burgundy Global's Singapore lawyers and advertisement in the Philippines. The issues before the Court of Appeal included whether a Singapore court had jurisdiction under O 48 of the ROC to make an EJD order against a corporate officer who was based overseas, and if so whether leave was required to serve the order out of the jurisdiction and whether leave should be granted.\n34 On the issue of jurisdiction, the Court began by noting (at [61]) that nothing in the language of O 48 r 1 barred the court from issuing EJD orders against company officers who were ordinarily resident overseas. The directors, however, submitted that there was a presumption against extraterritoriality in statutory interpretation, whereby O 48 r 1 should be confined to company officers who were resident in Singapore because of concerns relating to enforcement and international comity. The Court examined a number of English cases, observing (at [78]) that they \"do not appear to speak with one voice\", and distinguished between personal jurisdiction, meaning whether a person is or can be brought before a court, and substantive jurisdiction, meaning what a court can do to regulate the conduct in another country of a person over whom it has personal jurisdiction. The question of substantive jurisdiction was concerned with giving effect to the presumption against extraterritoriality (at [81]), and where the EJD order was sought against a foreign officer the issue was whether the court should exercise personal jurisdiction over the officer; and \"in coming to a decision on this it seems inevitable that it should also have regard to whether this is merely the prelude to the impermissible exercise of exorbitant substantive jurisdiction\" (at [82]).\n35 The Court's examination of the English cases included the observation (at [86]):\n... But companies can only act through individuals, and the only way a court can exert control over companies would be to issue orders - whether directly or indirectly - against those individuals who act on its behalf and who are able to effect the corporate litigant's compliance with the order of the court. If a court was not able to issue orders against such foreign officers, then they would not have the means to control foreign companies which are legitimately within its personal and substantive jurisdiction. This would be a surprising result and one we are unwilling to reach.\n36 On the interpretation of O 48 r 1, the Court declined to apply the English case of Masri v Consolidated Contractors International (UK) Ltd (No 4)[2010] 1 AC 90, in which it had been held that under the English counterpart of O 48 r 1 a court could not make an EJD order against an officer of a corporate judgment debtor who was ordinarily resident abroad. It was said (at [87]) that the civil procedure rules in Singapore were different, and on the basis that the power existed to issue an EJD order out of the jurisdiction against the director or officer of a corporate litigant, the concerns there expressed could be addressed by the court when it came to consider whether it would exercise its power and permit a party to proceed against the foreign directors or officers of a corporate litigant: that was a matter of which arose at the leave stage. Separately holding that leave was required to serve an EJD order out of the jurisdiction, it was said (at [92]) that \"any concerns relating to the imposition of extraterritorial jurisdiction on a foreign officer can be considered and addressed at the stage where leave is sought to serve an EJD order abroad\", and the Court continued:\n93. Indeed, in our judgment, service is the crucial act that engages the court's jurisdiction over a foreign person. As a matter of Singapore law, personal jurisdiction may be found when the putative defendant is physically within the jurisdiction at the time, the writ is served on him ... or when the requirements stipulated in O 11 of the ROC have been met and leave has been given for a writ to be served on the defendant not physically within the confines of Singapore ...\n94. To hold that there is an absolute prohibition on the issuance of EJD orders against foreign officers would go too far because it is entirely conceivable for such an order to be served within the jurisdiction when the officer comes to Singapore for a temporary visit. Even an originating process may be validly served in this manner ... But whether the EJD Order may be served out of jurisdiction is an entirely separate matter, and it is at that stage that the court may weigh the competing considerations ...\n[emphasis in original]\n37 From Burgundy Global, there was power in the Assistant Registrar to make the EJD order requiring the attendance of Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) to be examined and the production by them of Senda's books and documents, notwithstanding that they were foreign nationals and out of the jurisdiction. The order could remain unserved and inoperative, held in prospect of them coming to Singapore and being served. Any concerns over extraterritoriality in the exercise of exorbitant substantive jurisdiction would arise on the application to serve the EJD order on Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) out of jurisdiction, not at the time of making the order.\nThe Applicants' contentions: discussion\n38 As has been noted, the Applicants' contended that both the EJD order and the service out order should be set aside on the same grounds of lack of close connection, contravention of Chinese law, and other ways to obtain the information. These were, however, described by the Applicants as matters which \"militate against the Court's exercise of such jurisdiction\". Despite the lumping together this was a recognition that they go to whether the court should exercise personal jurisdiction over the officers by the \"crucial act\" of service, that is, at the time of the application for the service out order. In the scene set by Burgundy Global , they are not grounds for impugning the making of the EJD order.\n39 The Applicants' lumping together of the EJD order and the service order may have been contributed to by the reports of Mr Wang and Dr Dong, in which opinions were exchanged on whether the EJD order or compliance with it involved contravention of Chinese law. Their debate in those terms is understandable when they would have been unaware of Burgundy Global. At the hearing Mr Toh appeared to accept that, on the authority of Burgundy Global, the grounds did not come into the making of the EJD order, but into the making of the service out order. In any event, that is the case. Even if made out, they are not a basis for setting aside the EJD order.\n40 Nor is there any question of failure in the duty of full and frank disclosure. The submission, also made globally in relation to both the EJD order and the service out order, was that Ms Fan's residency in China, the potential contravention of Chinese law, and the existence of the Treaty were \"material facts which should have been highlighted\" in the exparte application. However, without now going into whether they were material facts which should have been highlighted, they similarly would only come into the making of the service out order.\n41 In oral submissions, Mr Toh's argument for setting the EJD order aside became that the application for the order, or at least the continuance of the order, was an abuse of process. This had appeared in the Applicants' written submissions as a \"preliminary issue\". In those submission the ultimate submission was that Kiri's purpose was to inconvenience Ms Fan and Mr Ruan in having them come to Singapore or putting them in jeopardy of either contravening Chinese law or the EJD order; it was also suggested that Kiri was \"harassing and oppressing\" Mr Ruan \"perhaps (unjustifiably) for not trying hard enough to get Senda to carry out the buyout\".\n42 In oral submissions, I think these excesses were not maintained. There were a number of strands to the argument, with some crossover with the adjournment application. One was that the application for the EJD order was for the ulterior purpose of obtaining evidence of Senda's means for use in SUM 24, evidence going to its ability to give effect to the buy-out order either to contest Senda's position that it did not have and could not obtain the necessary funds or to help in arriving at an alternative order. Another (perhaps inconsistently) was that Kiri already knew Senda's means from its evidence in SUM 24, so there was no longer a proper purpose in the examination. Another was that by one or other of the proposals in SUM 24 earlier described, the costs would be paid by Senda, so there was no point in an examination of its means and production of its books and records and again there was no proper purpose in the examination. It was also said that the questionnaires went beyond inquiry into Senda's means, and well (again perhaps inconsistently) that Senda had offered to provide answers to the questionnaires, which would have obviated the need for the examination but which Kiri had unreasonably refused.\n43 There is no merit in this argument, and that includes rejection of the suggested ultimate purpose and the suggested harassment and oppression. The question in SUM 24 was Senda's ability to pay US$603.8m for Kiri's shares in DyStar, essentially its ability to raise the funds from external sources; that is a vastly different question from Senda's ability to pay costs in the order of S$6.6m and examination into Senda's ability to pay the vastly smaller amount would not have shed useful light on its ability to pay the US$603.8m. I do not accept the suggested ulterior purpose. Conversely, SUM 24 was concerned with Senda's ability to pay the vastly larger amount, it was not a venue for testing its ability to pay in the order of S$6.6m, and there remained a proper purpose in the application. That is underscored by the fact that in entering into the tripartite agreement Senda held out that it could pay the costs, and even when it declined to pay its reason was not that it did not have the means to pay, but a quibble over the amount to be paid to DyStar; Kiri had and still has understandable reason to enquire into Senda's ability to pay the lesser amount through the EJD order. For the reasons given in relation to adjournment, that one of the proposals in SUM 24 might eventually lead to payment of the costs does not make Kiri's continuation of the application pointless, let alone an abuse of process. And finally, the questionnaires: they do not manifestly go beyond proper inquiry into Senda's means and it would be for the Registrar to rule on any particular objection to questioning in the examination hearing, and the proposal for answering the questionnaires was qualified - Kiri should not be required to accept whatever answers are given, and is entitled to go further in examining the Senda officers.\nConclusion as to the EJD Order\n44 The challenge to the EJD order is not successful; it stands.\nThe Service Out Order\nThe making of the order\n45 Order 11 r 8 of the ROC provides:\n(1) Subject to Order 69, Rule 10, service out of Singapore of any summons, notice, or order issued, given or made in any proceedings is permissible only with the leave of the Court, but leave shall not be required in any proceedings in which leave for service of the originating process has already been granted.\n(2) Rule 2 shall, so far as applicable, apply in relation to an application for the grant of leave under this Rule.\n(3) Rules 3, 4 and 6 apply in relation to any document for the service of which out of Singapore leave has been granted under this Rule as they apply in relation to an originating process.\n46 It was held in Burgundy Global that the qualification in Rule 8(1) where leave for service of the originating process had already been granted did not dispense with the need for leave where a summons, notice or order was to be served out of jurisdiction on a non-party. It was not in contest that leave was required for service of the EJD order out of Singapore.\n47 Order 11 r 2, taken up in Rule 8(2), relevantly provides that an application for the grant of leave must be made by exparte summons supported by an affidavit stating certain matters, including \"in what place or country the defendant is, or probably may be found\" (O 11 r 2(1)(c)), and that no leave is to be granted \"unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of Singapore under this Order\" (O 11 r 2(2)). Order 11 rr 3, 4 and 6, taken up in Rule 8(3), are made applicable to any document for the service of which out of Singapore leave has been granted under the Rule; they are concerned with modes of service abroad.\n48 Kiri applied for the service out order by an exparte summons SIC/SUM 36/2023 filed on 15 September 2023. It asked for leave to serve the EJD order on Senda at the Hong Kong address, on Ms Fan at the Hong Kong address \"or elsewhere as Fan Jing may be found in Hong Kong\", and on Mr Ruan at an address in China, alternatively at the Hong Kong address, or elsewhere as he may be found \"in China, and/or ... Hong Kong\".\n49 The application was supported by another affidavit of Mr Kiri. As to Ms Fan being found in Hong Kong, he referred to a Notice of Change of Company Director for Senda in the Hong Kong Integrated Companies Registry Information System (\"ICRIS\") showing her \"Correspondence Address\" as the Hong Kong address, and a Director's Particulars search showing the same, and said:\n11. I note that the above 'Correspondence Address' of Fan is also the registered office of Senda in Hong Kong, as reflected in the Company Particulars Search obtained from ICRIS dated 5 September 2023 ... Kiri has not been able to identify any other addresses for Fan.\n12. Accordingly, based on the above, to the best of my information, knowledge and belief, Fan is located in Hong Kong.\n50 The order was made by an Assistant Registrar on 18 September 2023.\nThe Applicants' contentions: discussion\n51 Under O 11 r 2, there is a discretion to grant leave to serve the EJD order out of Singapore, if it sufficiently appears to the Court that the case is a proper one to do so. The Applicants did not say otherwise. Their submission that the leave should not have been granted was on the three grounds earlier stated (at [26]), plus the failure to give full and frank disclosure.\n52 I return to Burgundy Global. As earlier explained, the Court held that the application for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction is the time when the court \"may weigh the competing considerations\". When the Court turned to whether leave should be granted in that case, after accepting that the leave could be granted retrospectively, it was said:\n111. In our judgment, however, the discretion to grant leave to serve an EJD order out of jurisdiction is one that must be exercised sparingly. As we noted in PT Bakrie Investindo v Global Distressed Alpha Fund 1 Ltd Partnership [2013] 4 SLR 1116 at [16], the predominant purpose of an EJD order is to obtain information to assist the judgment creditor in executing his judgment. In this respect it is very similar to a subpoena - both are orders directed at persons who might not necessarily be parties to the suit requiring them to provide relevant information to the court. Both are equally intrusive in that they generally require the person against whom the order is made to attend court personally. We note that under O 38 r 16(2), a person served with a subpoena to produce documents could sufficiently comply by causing the documents to be produced without attending personally; no such option exists in the ROC for a person served with an EJD order. We also return here to the observation we have made at [82] above, which is that even though the application for leave might appear to be one that is directed at invoking the court's personal jurisdiction over the non-party in question, that is only anterior to the further question of whether this will ultimately entail the exercise of exorbitant substantive jurisdiction to an impermissible degree.\n112. Having said that, we do not think it would be appropriate to lay down strict or exhaustive rules as to when a court may exercise its discretion to allow service abroad of an EJD order. The fundamental question is whether the foreign officer is so closely connected to the substantive claim that the Singapore court is justified in taking jurisdiction over him. We nevertheless make two tentative points. First, as the whole point of an EJD order is to obtain information about the judgment debtor's finances, the extent of the foreign officer's knowledge of his company's financial affairs will be an important threshold consideration. Parties should not be allowed to haul before the court a foreign officer who is unlikely to possess any relevant information. But even if a foreign officer has relevant information, that fact alone would generally be insufficient; after all, the same could be said about any individual sought to be subpoenaed to give evidence. Something more would be required. For example, the court might wish to consider the extent of the foreign officer's involvement in the matters relating to the claim. It might be easier to justify invoking the court's jurisdiction over a foreign officer who has played a key role in the events giving rise to the judgment creditor's successful claim. Ultimately, the duty is on the judgment creditor to persuade the court that this is a proper case to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdiction.\n53 The Applicants' ground (a) took up the question of a sufficiently close connection with the substantive claim (see [26]). But Burgundy Global was carefully not strict or exhaustive, and the Applicants put forward grounds (b) and (c) as other factors militating against the exercise of the discretion to grant leave to serve the EJD order, with particular emphasis on the caution against leave being the preliminary to the excessive exercise of an exorbitant substantive jurisdiction.\n54 I will come to the test of a sufficiently close connection with the underlying claim in considering the Applicants' ground (a), but Burgundy Global establishes, and the application of the test in that case as later described demonstrates, that the discretion to grant leave to serve an EJD order must \"be exercised sparingly\". In ChangfengShipping Holdings Ltd v Sinoriches Enterprises Co Ltd [2021] 2 HKC 472, while adopting the approach of the Singapore Court of Appeal and applying a slightly modified sufficiently close connection test, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance did not fully accept that the discretion to exercise jurisdiction should be sparingly exercised, saying that while there was a need to exercise the discretion with extreme caution, \"this qualitative restraint should not be translated into a quantitative restraint\" (at [28]) and that \"[i]n these days and age, the discretion properly exercised does not offend international law or comity\" (at [29]). But my instruction is from the Court of Appeal.\nGround (a): sufficiently close connection\n55 As Senda's sole director, Ms Fan will have knowledge of Senda's property and means of satisfying the costs liability, and the ability to produce its books and records. But so far as appears, she has no connection to speak of with the substantive claim, whether the claim be regarded as the underlying proceedings in which the costs orders were made or (as the Applicants took it) the resulting costs liability. In his affidavit dated 21 July 2023 filed in support of SUM 24, Mr Kiri said that he believed she was Mr Ruan's assistant, a description he maintained in an affidavit in this application, but there is nothing before me to indicate whether in that capacity she was more than an amanuensis or what part if any she played in the matters litigated between Kiri and Senda, including the involvement of Longsheng as detailed in the judgments in the oppression proceedings.\n56 In that respect, her position is similar to that of Mr Serafica, one of the directors in Burgundy Global . There was no evidence that the other directors had any knowledge of the company's activities and assets, but it was argued from a phrase in his affidavit that he did. The Court considered that it was not open for Transocean to rely on the affidavit, but said (at [114]):\n... But even if the contents of Mr Serafica's affidavit were taken into account, we have already noted that the mere fact that an officer has some information about the company's finances would normally not be sufficient to justify the court's exercise of its jurisdiction extraterritorially over that officer. No other evidence was provided by Transocean as to why we should exercise a discretion in this case, aside from some assertions by counsel that Mr Serafica had been intimately involved in the initial stages of the proceedings. For these reasons, we do not think that this is a proper case for granting leave.\n57 A close connection with the substantive claim, while described in Burgundy Global at [112] as fundamental, is also described as something which the court might wish to consider, and which might make it easier to justify invoking the court's jurisdiction over the foreign officer. It can be the \"something more\" in addition to the foreign officer having relevant information, but there can be some other \"something more\", and the ultimate question is whether the court is persuaded that it is a proper case to grant leave to serve out of the jurisdiction. Is there something more in the present case?\n58 Mr Rajan did not suggest something more; his submissions really did not grapple with ground (a). The emphasis on a close connection with the substantive claim can give room for manipulation, with the judgment debtor ensuring that the officers with knowledge of the company's affairs are officers who have had no connection with the substantive litigation; in that event, the significance of a close connection may diminish. In SUM 24, it was suggested that Ms Fan replaced Mr Ruan in order to distance Mr Ruan from Senda's affairs, the response to which was that Mr Ruan remained an officer of Longsheng and DyStar which he would not have done if that were the reason for his replacement. Mr Rajan did not make a like suggestion, and I do not think it can properly be found that there was manipulation in this case. And it would be difficult to hold any such manipulation against Ms Fan, who as Mr Ruan's assistant would be likely to have been manipulatee rather than manipulator, when considering the intrusion involved in taking jurisdiction over her.\n59 I do not think that Ms Fan satisfies the close connection test, or that there is otherwise justification in invoking the court's jurisdiction over her. On ground (a), the leave order should be set aside so far as it concerns her.\n60 Mr Ruan is not in the same position. Although no longer an officer of Senda, he has knowledge of Senda's property and its means of satisfying the costs liability, and any question of the extent of his current knowledge will be a matter for the Registrar at his examination. He was in the thick of the underlying litigation, as witness and as a person involved in the oppressive acts as found on which the buy-out order was made, and whether the claim be regarded as the underlying litigation or the costs liability he has a close connection with it. It is not a case of consequential setting aside of the service out order so far as it concerns him.\nGround (b): contravention of Chinese law\n61 Disentangled from ground (c), with which there was some overlap, the Applicants' argument rested on Article 284 of the Civil Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China (\"the Civil Procedure Law\"). It and the preceding Article 283 provided:\nArticle 283 Pursuant to the international treaty concluded or participated by the People's Republic of China or in accordance with the principle of reciprocity, a People's Court and a foreign court may request each other to carry out service of documents on behalf, investigation and collection of evidence and any other litigation acts. Where a request by a foreign court for assistance is prejudicial to the sovereignty, security, or public interest of the People's Republic of China, the People's Court shall refuse to enforce.\nArticle 284 Request for and provision of judicial assistance shall be carried out via the channels stipulated in the international treaty concluded or participated by the People's Republic of China; where there is no treaty relations, request for and provision of judicial assistance shall be carried out via diplomatic channels. An embassy or consulate of a foreign country based in the People's Republic of China may serve documents on a citizen of the foreign country and carry out investigation and collection of evidence, but shall not violate the laws of the People's Republic of China and shall not adopt mandatory measures.\nExcept for the circumstances stipulated in the preceding paragraph, no foreign agency or individual shall carry out service of documents, investigation and collection of evidence in the People's Republic of China without the consent by the relevant administrative authorities of the People of Republic of China.\n62 Distilled from the submissions as a whole, the argument as based on Mr Wang's reports went as follows. The EJD order requires Ms Fan to provide evidence, by attending before the Registrar and being examined and by producing Senda's documents. She is a Chinese national resident in China. The Treaty is in force between Singapore and China, providing in its Article 2 for the mutual provision of judicial assistance by both contracting parties in, amongst other matters, \"the taking of evidence\". If the Treaty applies to provision of evidence by her (which for ground (c) the Applicants said it did), then by force of Article 284 of the Civil Procedure Law, the only way she can be required to produce evidence is by a request for judicial assistance through the Treaty; as explained by Mr Wang, this involves evaluation of the request and review of the resulting evidence by courts in China, and the evidence would not be taken before the Registrar in Singapore but would be taken by a court in China and transmitted to the Singapore courts. If the Treaty does not apply, then also by force of Article 284 the collection of her evidence requires the consent of the relevant Chinese administrative authorities, and again the evidence would be collected not by examination before the Registrar in Singapore, but in China. Either way, according to Mr Wang, it would be a breach of Chinese law to compel a witness within China to provide evidence in Singapore proceedings in some other way, that is, not by the Treaty procedure or with prior consent of the relevant Chinese administrative authorities; the service out order is therefore contrary to Chinese law.\n63 Mr Wang's opinion was expressed in relation to the EJD order itself, but as earlier explained the service of the order is the crucial act and I have directed his opinion to the service out order. Mr Wang also opined that the EJD order would be an exercise of the Singapore Court's jurisdiction within China, and that disregard of Chinese law as described would be considered an encroachment on Chinese sovereignty; if also directed to the service out order, however, that is not in point as the ground is that Chinese law would be contravened and depends on examination of that law.\n64 Dr Dong took issue with Mr Wang in two principal respects. First, in his opinion the EJD order did not involve the collection of evidence within Articles 283 and 284. Under Chinese law, he said, evidence was what was provided to prove the facts which the parties relied on to support their respective cases in the trial proceedings, and after judgment \"the concept of evidence is no longer relevant in the subsequent enforcement proceedings\". The EJD order required attendance in Singapore to be orally examined in order to identify the assets of Senda in aid of enforcing the debt owed by it, which was similar to the Chinese mechanism of an order to report property in the enforcement of a judgment and was not taking evidence as understood in Chinese law. Secondly, in any event the EJD order was not a violation of Article 284, because what was really prohibited under Chinese law was carrying out the investigation and collection of evidence in the territory of China; it would be permissible for a person to go out of China to be orally examined before a foreign court, and Article 284 was not a prohibition on a foreign court ordering a person to do so. These contentions can similarly be directed to the service out order as the crucial act enlivening the potential operation of the EJD order in relation to Ms Fan.\n65 As to the collection of evidence, Mr Wang's response in his second report was that the concept of evidence was relevant to civil procedure in general and was not confined to trial or pre-judgment stages, with reference to provisions said to illustrate the relevance of the concept in Chinese enforcement proceedings. One provision was concerned with evidence to support an application in enforcement proceedings, but there were some in which materials showing the judgment debtor's means were referred to as evidence.\n66 The concept of evidence can certainly be relevant in enforcement proceedings, such as the evidence put forward in order to obtain an EJD order or an order to report property, and as well the materials showing the judgment debtor's means can be described as evidence of their means. The question, however, is what is meant by collection of evidence in Articles 283 and 284 of the Civil Procedure Law.\n67 In interpreting the Articles, it must be remembered that they and the other provisions in Chinese law are before me in translation and nuances of words and expression may have been lost; with the best of assistance from Mr Wang and Dr Dong, it would be wrong to take definitive guidance from the words alone. I consider that I should seek to be guided also by considering the intent of the Articles. Their intent, it seems to me, is to have a wide operation whereby either through the use of treaty procedures or by necessary consent of Chinese administrative authorities, any activity constituting the collection of evidence in a wide sense is subject to Chinese oversight; a legalistic concept of evidence is not the answer. In this respect I prefer Mr Wang's opinion: examination of a judgment debtor to ascertain their means, in my view, is a collection of evidence caught by the Articles.\n68 As to collection of evidence in the territory of China, Mr Wang's response was that the EJD order sought to impose a legal obligation over individuals in China to produce evidence in the course of and for the purposes of Singapore legal proceedings, and \"the purport and substance of the EJD Order is to collect evidence from witnesses in the PRC, which falls squarely within the scope and intention of Article 284...\". He gave four reasons. One was that Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) were required to provide a written response to the questionnaire before the hearing, and that this was collecting evidence in China. The second was that compelling a witness in China to leave China to provide evidence for foreign proceedings \"infringes the spirit and intent of Article 284\" and constituted the collection of evidence; it was \"analogous to a situation where a resident in the PRC is compelled to physically take evidence from the PRC and bring it to the Singapore courts\". The third was that Article 284 \"unequivocally prescribes\" that no foreign agency is allowed to collect evidence in the PRC without the requisite approval from the relevant PRC administrative authorities. The fourth was that because the proposed method of collection of evidence in the EJD order circumvented the prescribed method through which agencies were allowed to collect evidence from individuals in China, the order violated Chinese law and sovereignty.\n69 I do not find these reasons persuasive. The Articles are concerned with (relevantly) the provision of judicial assistance either pursuant to a treaty or in the absence of a treaty, meaning assistance to a foreign court in doing something within China, and otherwise with the service of documents and investigation and collection of evidence within China: the last sentence in Article 284 is clear in stating the scope of the acts as acts within China. It is the collection of evidence within China which is to be subject to Chinese oversight. The EJD order does not require any collection of evidence within China, but that Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) come to Singapore and be examined and produce documents. They must bring a completed questionnaire, but it does not have to be completed in China, and even if it were it is the production to the Registrar in Singapore which is the collection of the evidence. Compelling a witness in China to leave China to provide evidence for foreign proceedings, in the sense that the EJD order purports to order the witness to do so, is the antithesis of the collection of evidence in China - the collection of evidence is where the witness goes to for the foreign proceedings. The third reason does not take the matter further, and whatever may be said of the imposition upon Ms Fan (and Mr Ruan) and infringement of Chinese sovereignty, that is not caught by the Articles.\n70 On this matter, Dr Dong's position is to be preferred. I therefore do not accept that the service out order should be set aside as against Ms Fan on ground (b). Mr Ruan is in no better position.\n71 I should note an argument hinted at in Kiri's written submissions, but not developed by Mr Rajan, that the service out order was for service on Ms Fan in Hong Kong as someone to be found in Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong law and not Chinese law would be the consideration when deciding whether leave to serve out of the jurisdiction should be granted. In the absence of development and answer I am reluctant to express a concluded view, and it is not necessary to do so. As at present advised, I do not think the argument has merit. Service of the EJD order is one thing, and carrying it out and compliance with it is another and different thing.\nGround (c): other ways to obtain the information\n72 The ground rested on the Treaty. I have referred to its Article 2, providing for mutual judicial assistance in (amongst other things) the taking of evidence. By its Article 12:\n1. In civil and commercial matters, the court of one Contracting Party may request the other Contracting Party to take evidence which it deems necessary such as the examination of parties, witnesses and experts and the production of documents.\n2. The evidence maybe taken before the court of the requested party or any fit and proper person named in the Letter of Request or such other person as the court of the requested party thinks fit.\n73 Implicit in the Applicants' submissions was that the examination of a judgment debtor, including an officer of a corporate judgment debtor, is a taking of evidence which can be the subject of a Letter of Request, and that Kiri could have initiated a Letter of Request asking that the Chinese courts conduct the examination of Ms Fan. They submitted that the service out order should be set aside because the EJD order should not be given effect by service out when that alternative legitimate procedure existed, one which did not involve infringement of Chinese sovereignty and imposition of extraterritorial jurisdiction over Ms Fan. The Applicants relied in particular on Mackinnon v Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp [1986] Ch 482 (\" Mackinnon \"), Nix vEmerdata Ltd[2022] EWHC 718 (Comm) (\" Nix \") and Gorbachev vGuriev[2023] KB 1 (\" Gorbachev \").\n74 In Mackinnon the plaintiff obtained exparte a bankers' book order against an American bank, a non-party to the litigation, requiring the bank to produce documents held at its head office in New York, and a subpoena against an officer of the bank at its London office. Both the order and the subpoena were set aside. An alternative procedure was available of application to a court in New York, an application which required the leave of the United Kingdom court which was likely to be given. It was held that there was personal jurisdiction over the bank because of its branch within the jurisdiction, but that save in exceptional circumstances the court should not require production by a non-party of documents outside the jurisdiction concerning business which it has transacted outside the jurisdiction, on the principle \"that a state should refrain from demanding obedience to its sovereign authority by foreigners in respect of their conduct outside the jurisdiction\" (at 493G). When considering whether there were exceptional circumstances, Hoffmann J said (at 499F) that \"in a case like this, where alternative legitimate procedures are available, an infringement of sovereignty can seldom be justified except perhaps on the grounds of urgent necessity ...\".\n75 In Nix, the defendant applied for third party disclosure against a firm of New York lawyers which had provided advice to the plaintiff, and for permission to serve the application on the lawyers out of the jurisdiction. Cockerill J concluded that there was no jurisdiction to make the service out order, but said (at [23]) that even if there were jurisdiction to make an order for service out contemplating an application against a foreign non-party for disclosure, she \"would not be minded to order it in circumstances where, for example, one is plainly trespassing on the letter of request regime\". Her Ladyship explained that a court would only exercise its discretion to order a letter of request outwards in circumstances which paralleled the letter of request inwards, and that the court would not permit letters of request inwards for disclosure because any foreign court seeking documents from a person resident within the jurisdiction must only ask for individual documents separately described. She said (at [27]):\nThis application is in essence (and acknowledged to be) a way around the letter of request regime. The letter of request regime is the proper, courteous, respectful method of obtaining evidence within a foreign jurisdiction from a foreign party. It is a very sensitive topic in many jurisdictions; one can see this in relation to disclosure via the many, many reservations to disclosure which are appended to the Hague Convention. Many countries take a still more cautious line as to disclosure generally and third-party disclosure in particular than this jurisdiction does. In those circumstances, it would be invidious for this court to attempt to impose its standards on a third party based in another jurisdiction by an assertion of direct jurisdiction over them.\n76 In Gorbachev the plaintiff applied for an order for third party disclosure against a firm of English solicitors in relation to documents held by the firm on behalf of certain Cypriot companies. Permission was granted to serve the application on the Cypriot companies. In an appeal by the Cypriot companies against Jacob J's refusal to set aside the service, it was held that there was jurisdiction to make the disclosure order when the documents were within England and Wales, and that the judge's exercise of his discretion to make the service out order could not be said to have been wrong. The judge had recognised that the judgment in Nix \"sets out powerful reasons why, generally speaking, applications against overseas third-parties should generally be made using the letter of request regime\", but considered that a number of matters including the fact that the documents were within the jurisdiction were nonetheless sufficient to justify the exercise of the court's discretion to order service out. The Court of Appeal itself referred with apparent approval (at [59]) to Cockerill J's description of the letter of request procedure as the proper, courteous, respectful method of obtaining evidence within a foreign jurisdiction from a foreign party, and observed (at [82]) that circumventing the letter of request procedure and its limitations would \"infringe international comity in ways that would be objectionable to foreign states\". When leaving for later decision whether there was jurisdiction to make an order in relation to documents not within England and Wales, the Court said (at [90]):\nEven if jurisdiction exists to make an order against a third party for production of documents held abroad, in view of the availability of the letter of request procedure it would only be in an exceptional case that it would be appropriate to exercise that jurisdiction, for the reasons given by Cockerill J in Nix vEmerdata Ltd. Still less would it be appropriate to do so in order to obtain documents (for example, classes of documents) which could not be obtained pursuant to a letter of request.\n77 In these cases, both the availability of the letter of request procedure and the limits on its availability were taken into account. A disclosure order against a foreign non-party and an EJD order against a foreign non-party are alike as a command to the recipient, in the one case to produce documents to a court in the jurisdiction and in the other case to attend and be examined (and also to produce documents) in the jurisdiction. In Burgundy Global at [111] it was recognised that an EJD order was intrusive in similar manner to a subpoena in generally requiring the person against whom the order is made to attend court personally, and concern was expressed for the exercise of exorbitant substantive jurisdiction to an impermissible degree: that must include particular regard to comity where a letter of request procedure is in force between the forum and the country of the recipient's residence. In my view, in the sparing exercise of the discretion to grant leave to serve an EJD order out of the jurisdiction, it is appropriate to have regard to the Treaty if it provides a way of examining Senda's officers as to its means.\n78 Mr Rajan did not question that the Treaty provides a way of enquiring into Senda's means, or question that the EJD order could be implemented by judicial assistance under the Treaty. It does not follow that a service out order for the EJD order should be refused: regard to the Treaty does not mean that it must be followed, as the outcome in Gorbachev illustrates.\n79 Mr Wang explains the procedure under China's Implementing Rules for Service and Evidence relevant to a request for judicial assistance, and the procedure would not be as speedy as an examination before the Registrar in Singapore: in seeking to serve Mr Ruan pursuant to the Treaty, Kiri was told that it would take six to nine months, and an examination will surely not be speedier. The enquiry would be before a Court in China, less convenient for Kiri. On the other hand, the EJD order is of questionable utility when it cannot readily be enforced unless Ms Fan chooses to come within the jurisdiction, a matter noted in relation to the disclosure order in Gorbachev (at [82]): the long way is likely to be the productive way.\n80 It is no small thing to command a Chinese national resident in China to come to Singapore to be examined, and to produce documents in Singapore, as the EJD order itself says under pain of being \"liable to process of execution\" and as the questionnaire says being liable to fine or imprisonment. Unless there is good reason, the available Treaty process should be followed. In my view, on ground (c) also the service out order, the crucial act in making that command, should be set aside so far as it concerns Ms Fan.\n81 It is difficult to see why this ground does not apply equally to the service out order so far as it concerns Mr Ruan. The service out order should also be set aside so far as it concerns him, but subject to any application made within 10 days by the parties or either of them to vary or discharge the order; any such application may be made by letter to the Registry.\nFull and frank disclosure\n82 It is unnecessary to consider whether there was failure in full and frank disclosure when the service out order was obtained. However, I will briefly explain why I would have set the order aside so far as it concerns Ms Fan for that reason also.\n83 The principles governing disclosure in an exparte application were not in dispute. Kiri was obliged to disclose material facts which it knew or ought to have known had it made proper enquiries, being facts which the Court should consider in coming to its decision: see generally BahteraOffshore (M) Sdn Bhd v Sim Kok Bengand another [2009] 4 SLR(R) 365 at [20]-[23]. It could not be gainsaid that if Ms Fan resided in China, that was a matter of importance. It would have brought into consideration use of the Treaty procedure for service on Ms Fan, a matter within Kiri's understanding at the time in relation to Mr Ruan: Mr Kiri's affidavit included that Kiri understood that the documents could only lawfully be served on Mr Ruan, a Chinese citizen situated in China, pursuant to the Treaty. It would have brought into consideration compliance with Chinese law in carrying out the EJD order, a matter different from its service, and Kiri was alive to Article 284 and should have been alive to the question debated between Mr Wang and Dr Dong.\n84 In his affidavit Mr Kiri asserted that \"to the best of my knowledge, information and belief\" Ms Fan was \"located in Hong Kong\", with the basis for this conclusion being the \"Correspondence Address\" in the documents filed with the Hong Kong authorities, and said that Kiri had not been able to identify any other addresses for Ms Fan. The same affidavit included that a Directors' Particulars search obtained from ICRIS stated Mr Ruan's \"Correspondence Address\" as the Hong Kong address, but referred also to three other documents showing addresses for Mr Ruan in China; while the affidavit asserted that, based on these documents, to the best of Mr Kiri's knowledge, information, and belief Mr Ruan was \"located in China and/or in Hong Kong\". This and the known fact that the Hong Kong address was Senda's registered office suggested that the \"Correspondence Address\" was not a true guide to the residence of Ms Fan. Ms Fan was known (and disclosed) to be a Chinese citizen, her possible residence in China was material, and little more could have brought the Assistant Registrar to the view that Ms Fan was resident in China and either not \"located in Hong Kong\" or, if \"located in Hong Kong\" in the sense of having a presence there, nonetheless resident in China.\n85 There was more known to Kiri at the time. It disclosed Mr Ruan's former directorship of Senda, and that Senda was a wholly owned subsidiary of Longsheng and Mr Ruan was the \"Chairman and General Manager\" of Longsheng. But it knew that Longsheng was a substantial Chinese-based company and that Senda was an investment vehicle for Longsheng, not an actively trading company, and from Mr Ruan's involvement in the oppression proceedings Kiri could not reasonably have thought other than that his responsibilities as a senior officer of Longsheng meant that he was located in China and that either one or both (depending on timing) of the Chinese addresses was a residential address or he was elsewhere resident in China. In an affidavit dated 21 July 2023 filed in SUM 24, Mr Kiri had said that he believed that Ms Fan was Mr Ruan's assistant. Those matters, if disclosed, would have significantly detracted from the already weak guide of the \"Correspondence Address\" to the \"location\" of Ms Fan: would not, or at least could not, Mr Ruan's true \"location\" be China, probably resident at one of the Chinese addresses, and would or could not his assistant also be \"located\" in China where he was \"located\" and probably also resident in China? The reference to the \"location\" of Ms Fan in Hong Kong masked the question of where she was resident and whether she was resident in China. As well, if Ms Fan was Mr Ruan's assistant, that could throw up whether she had a sufficiently close connection in accordance with Burgundy Global. These matters should have been disclosed.\n86 There was material non-disclosure. It is no answer to say, as Mr Rajan submitted in answer, that by the \"Correspondence Address\" Ms Fan had represented, \"If you want to give me notice, do so in Hong Kong\". It was not just a question of giving notice to Ms Fan.\n87 The Applicants submitted that there was also non-disclosure in that Kiri ought to have known that Ms Fan was resident in China, either by making public searches in China based on her identification number or by writing to her to ask about an arranged service. While Mr Kiri said that Kiri had not been able to identify any other addresses for Ms Fan, it was said, it had not tried to do so. I do not accept this. There was no evidence of what public searches could have been made to ascertain Ms Fan's residence. In July 2023 Kiri wrote to Senda's lawyers enquiring after instructions to accept service of any EJD order and accompanying questionnaires. A little later in July 2023, Kiri emailed Ms Fan and Mr Ruan informing them that the EJD proceedings had been commenced and steps would be taken to serve the relevant order and documents personally on them, and enquiring if they had appointed Singapore counsel to act on their behalf. There was no response to either enquiry. While Kiri did not specifically ask Ms Fan where she resided, I have no doubt that, if it had, there would have been no response.\n88 The Applicants also submitted that there was material non-disclosure in that in the later attempts to serve Ms Fan in Hong Kong, Kiri was told, as described at [93] below, that Ms Fan was \"not present\" at the Hong Kong address and \"should be in China too\", and in late October 2023 was told by Senda's lawyers that she was ordinarily resident in China; but, they said, it failed to file a supplementary affidavit to make voluntarily disclosure, referring to TheNorglimpt [1988] QB 183 at 187-188. Mr Rajan did not respond to the submission. The occasion for supplementary disclosure in the present circumstances may be debateable - so far as I am aware the matter has not yet been considered in Singapore - and, it being unnecessary to go into it, in the absence of full submissions I will not do so.\nConclusion as to the service out order\n89 The challenge to the service out order is successful. It should be set aside so far as it concerns Ms Fan, and also so far as it concerns Mr Ruan subject to any application as previously indicated.\nThe Substituted Service Order\n90 Since the service out order is set aside, the substituted service order as against Ms Fan loses its foundation, and must also be set aside. But I would have set the substituted service order aside in any event.\nThe making of the order\n91 Senda was duly served at the Hong Kong address, its registered office, although the documents were returned. Attempts to serve Ms Fan at the Hong Kong address, unsurprisingly, were not successful.\n93 Mr Lo had attended at the Hong Kong address, asked the man who answered the door if Ms Fan or Mr Ruan were present, and been told that the man recognised Mr Ruan's name as someone from Senda, but had not heard of Ms Fan's name before and had not seen her before. Mr Lo told the man that Ms Fan should be one of the bosses of Senda, to which the man replied that Senda's bosses were in China, so if Ms Fan was one of the bosses, she should be in China too. Mr Lo attended at the Hong Kong address on a later occasion. He asked the woman who answered the door if Ms Fan was present, and was told that she was not.\n94 Mr Suresh added that a woman who returned the documents left at the Hong Kong address for Senda told Kiri's Hong Kong lawyers that Senda was at the address, but not Ms Fan or Mr Ruan; she said Senda could be contacted to receive the documents if there were documents for Senda and provided the phone number of one \"Miki\". So far as appears, Kiri did not telephone \"Miki\". Mr Suresh said that Kiri had not been able to identify any other addresses for Ms Fan in Hong Kong or elsewhere, and that even though the man who answered the door at the Hong Kong address claimed that the bosses of Senda should be in China \"it appears that he was not a personnel of Senda, and it is also clear that he did not know who Fan was, or where Fan may be\". He said that based on the searches performed on ICRIS, meaning those which showed the Hong Kong address as Ms Fan's \"Correspondence Address\", to the best of Kiri's knowledge, information, and belief Ms Fan was \"in Hong Kong\".\n95 The substituted service order was made, in the terms as asked, on 26 October 2023. The EJD order and accompanying documents were sent via registered post to Ms Fan at the Hong Kong address, but the post office response was \"recipient not available\" and they were returned. The delivery and read receipt function of the email software showed that the email was delivered and read. According to Ms Fan, however, she was not aware of the emailed documents, and in any event could read and speak only Mandarin.\nThe Applicants' contentions: discussion\n96 The Applicants' primary submission was that the substituted service order should be set aside because the mode of service was contrary to Chinese law.\n97 As noted at [28] above, by O 48 r 1(2) the EJD order had to be served personally on Ms Fan. Order 62 r 5(1) of the ROC provides that if it appears to the Court impracticable for any reason to serve a document personally, the Court may make an order for substituted service of the document. The Applicants submitted that by O 11 r 8(3) of the ROC read with O 11 r 3(2), the EJD order could not be served out of the jurisdiction and in China in a manner contrary to Chinese law, and that the service was contrary to Chinese law because by force of Article 284 of the Civil Procedure Law the only permissible mode of service was pursuant to the Treaty.\n98 The first step in the argument is that the EJD order could not be served out of the jurisdiction and in China in a manner contrary to Chinese law. Order 11 r 8 is set out at [45] above. On the assumption of a valid grant of leave to serve the EJD order out of the jurisdiction, O 11 r 3 applies in relation to it. Order 11 r 3(2) provides that nothing in the Rule or in any order or direction of the Court made by virtue of it \"shall authorise or require the doing of anything in a country in which service is to be effected which is contrary to the law of the country\". In HumpussSea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another [2015] 4 SLR 625, the High Court stated (at [59]) that two of the common methods of service available irrespective of where the defendant resided were personal service and substituted service with leave of the Court, in each case provided it did not contravene the law of the foreign jurisdiction; and (at [85]-[87]) where the service was contrary to the law of the foreign jurisdiction and therefore invalid under O 11 r 3(2), the service was incapable of cure. Mr Rajan made no submission against this operation of the ROC.\n99 The second step in the argument is that service by a substituted service order was contrary to Chinese law. At least in relation to personal service, again Mr Rajan made no submission against service pursuant to the Treaty as the only permissible means of service on a Chinese national resident in China. In Kiri's application for the service out order, it exhibited the separate legal opinion from a Chinese lawyer that \"[d]ocuments can only be lawfully served on Ruan, a Chinese citizen situated in China, through the judicial assistance of the Chinese courts through the [Treaty]\", and its explanation for not having served Mr Ruan was that any service would have to be pursuant to the Treaty. It must be the same for substituted service: the Treaty procedure cannot be circumvented by an order for substituted service.\n100 What, then, was Mr Rajan's answer to the Applicants' submission? With respect, it was not clearly expressed, but its substance was that the substituted service order was validly made for service on Ms Fan not in China, but in Hong Kong, and the mode of service was valid under Hong Kong law. The point of the argument, as I understood it, was that compliance with Chinese law was irrelevant. There was evidence that substituted service by a means able to bring the document to the notice of the person to be served was available under Hong Kong law, and it was submitted that the order was properly made on what was known at the time and it did not matter if it is now known that Ms Fan was not in Hong Kong.\n101 Substituted service is not necessarily at a fixed physical location, and was not in this case insofar as the documents were to be sent to an email address. The Applicants submitted that a document is received by a person at the location where the person accesses the email inbox, referring to Maughan v Wilmot (No 2)[2016] 1 WLR 2200 at [19]-[20], and so the service by sending to the email address of a person resident in China would take place in China and would be contrary to Chinese law; since Ms Fan was resident in China, if she did read the email the service on her was contrary to Chinese law. It added that even for service pursuant to the Treaty, by a combination of Article 7 of the Treaty and Article 90 of the Civil Procedure Law, the Chinese court would only allow service by email if the potential recipient had consented to being served in that manner, and Ms Fan had not consented.\n102 There is force in the Applicants' response. However, Mr Rajan's position has difficulties at a more general level. If Ms Fan was resident in China, as on the evidence before me she was, and under Chinese law the only permissible means of service on her was pursuant to the Treaty, personal service on her would be contrary to Chinese law. How can that be overcome by substituted service instead of personal service? I do not see how the fact that the substituted service order was validly made in Hong Kong, if it be the fact, means that Chinese law was not infringed by its purported service on Ms Fan otherwise than pursuant to the Treaty. The substituted service order may be taken as a substitute for personal service on Ms Fan in Hong Kong, but she was resident in China and not in Hong Kong and could not be personally served there; if she was to be personally served, she had to be served in China, which was contrary to Chinese law. The substitute could not exceed that which it replaced. In my view, the substituted service order should be set aside as contrary to Chinese law.\n103 What Mr Rajan's argument does is focus attention on the Applicants' secondary submission, that the substituted service order should be set aside for failure in full and frank disclosure when Kiri applied for the order. I consider that the substituted service order should be set aside for that reason also. Again, I will be brief in saying why.\n104 I have explained why I consider that there was material non-disclosure at the time of obtaining the service out order. In the affidavits at the time of obtaining the substituted service order, even greater doubt appeared on whether Ms Fan \"is in Hong Kong\", the phrase used where previously the phrase had been \"located in Hong Kong\". Mr Lo was told that Ms Fan had not been seen before, and if she was one of Senda's bosses should be in China too, and the lawyer had been told that Ms Fan was not at the Hong Kong address. It should have been apparent from the lawyer being told that somebody from Senda could be contacted to receive documents that the Hong Kong address was no more than a postbox. The application was nonetheless maintained based on the \"Correspondence Address\"; but as in relation to the service out order, a material question was Ms Fan's residence, not whether she was \"in Hong Kong\". On Ms Fan's residence, none of the matters which I have said should have been disclosed in relation to the service out order were disclosed. There was the same material non-disclosure.\nConclusion as to the substituted service order\n105 The challenge to the substituted service order succeeds. It should be set aside because its foundation in the service out order has been lost, but it would in any event have been set aside.\nOther Matters\n106 The Applicants submitted that, if the orders as against Ms Fan and Mr Ruan were set aside, the like orders as against Senda should also be set aside as there was no point to them. Kiri did not respond to the submission. It is not clear to me that there is no point in the orders as against Senda remaining; if there is no point, they will fade into obscurity, but they should remain in case there is point.\n107 The prayer that the EJD order be varied by requiring compliance with Chinese law and procedures was repeated in the Applicants' written submissions, with refinement to variation requiring Kiri to obtain prior consent from the Chinese authorities and for the evidence to be taken in the manner prescribed by the Treaty. As explained in Burgundy Global, the EJD order may be served within the jurisdiction, with no question of compliance with Chinese law and procedures. Assuming that there is power to vary the order, for that reason alone I decline to do so. It may be that conditions on carrying the order into effect could have accompanied the service our order, but that order has been set aside and variation does not arise.\n108 The examination hearing is presently fixed for 9 July 2024. What will happen as a result of my decision of this application is not for me, although it seems unlikely that it will go ahead. However, for like reasons to those given in relation to the adjournment application, I decline to order that the examination hearing, if one eventuates, not occur until after SUM 24 has been decided.\n109 Finally, Kiri's written submissions included that this application had been commenced by Senda and Ms Fan for a collateral purpose, and should be dismissed as an abuse of process. From a remark made by Mr Rajan in the course of the hearing, I think the submission is not maintained, but I should nonetheless deal with it. The collateral purpose was said to be \"to delay and frustrate Kiri's lawful efforts to obtain information to aid in enforcing its outstanding costs orders...\". An account of events was given said to support that predominant purpose. Even if Ms Fan is to be equated with Senda, I am not prepared to find a purpose of delay and frustration, something beyond a continuation of the hard fought carriage of the underlying litigation. But I do not equate Ms Fan with Senda: the EJD order imposes upon her, under pain of punishment, and she is entitled to resist it or its implementation. If my decision of the application is correct, she has done so with considerable, although not complete, success, for a valid purpose.\nConclusion\n110 I decline to set aside the EJD order. The service out order is set aside so far as it concerns Ms Fan. It is also set aside so far as it concerns Mr Ruan, but subject to any application made within 10 days by the parties or either of them to vary or discharge the order; any such application may be made by letter to the Registry. It is not set aside so far as it concerns Senda. The substituted service order is set aside.\n111 If the parties are unable to agree on costs within 28 days, they should jointly inform the Registry, including stating the area(s) of disagreement. Directions will be given for decision on the area(s) of disagreement on written submissions.",

        "text": "In the singapore international Commercial court\nof the republic of singapore\n[2024] SGHC(I) 2\nSuit No 3 of 2018 (Summonses Nos 9 and 22 of 2023)\nBetween\nBaker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased)\n... Plaintiff\nAnd\nBCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd\nMarcus Weber\nRenslade Holdings Ltd\n... Defendants\nJudgment\n[Contempt of Court x Civil contempt]\n[Companies x Directors x Disqualification]\nBaker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased)\n1 This is a judgment about the consequences of disobeying an anti-suit injunction (\"ASI\").\n2 At the hearing on 6 September 2023, we decided that defendants BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd (\"BCS\") and Mr Marcus Weber (\"Weber\") - BCS's sole shareholder and sole director - had committed contempt of court by disobeying the ASI issued against them on 19 November 2021. We reserved our decision on the punishment for their contempt.\n3 In relation to Mr Hartono Sianto (\"Sianto\"), who was previously the sole director of BCS, we reserved our decision on whether he had committed contempt, and if so, what punishment would be appropriate.\n4 Besides the application for an order of committal in SIC/SUM 9/ 2023 (\"SUM 9\"), we also had before us an application by SIC/SUM 22/2023 (\"SUM 22\") to amend SUM 9 to seek a director disqualification order against Weber under s 154(2)(a) of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \"Companies Act\"). We directed the relevant parties to make further submissions on SUM 22, which we have since received and considered.\nBackground\nThe Dispute\n5 Dr Chantal Burnison (\"Chantal\") was the co-inventor of a compound called Ethocyn, a skin product said to make the skin look younger and better toned. Ethocyn was supplied to cosmetic manufacturers such as Nu Skin International (\"Nu Skin\"). Nu Skin made payments to BCS under a supply and distribution agreement.\n6 A dispute arose over the rights to the inventions and patents relating to Ethocyn (the \"Ethocyn Rights\"). The plaintiff, Mr Michael Baker (\"Baker\"), as the executor of Chantal's estate, contended that there was a trust (\"the Trust\") whereby Weber held the Ethocyn Rights and any income or proceeds generated from them on trust for Chantal (the \"Trust Assets\"), less 5% of such income and proceeds going to Weber as a commission - that trust covered 95% of monies paid by Nu Skin to BCS (the \"Trust Moneys\").\n7 Weber contended that he had purchased the Ethocyn Rights as a personal investment opportunity, and that all moneys earned from them belonged to him and his companies (including BCS and the third defendant, Renslade Holdings Limited (\"Renslade (HK)\")).\nThe Suit 3 Judgment\n8 On 20 November 2017, Baker sued BCS, Weber and Renslade (HK) (collectively, the \"Defendants\") in HC/S 1070/2017, which was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (\"SICC\") as SIC/S 3/2018 (\"Suit 3\"). After a trial, on 29 April 2020 the SICC gave Baker judgment[1](in Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others [2020] 4 SLR 85 (the \"Suit 3 Judgment\")) for the following:\n(a) a declaration that BCS and/or Renslade (HK) held the Ethocyn Rights and the Trust Assets (including the Trust Moneys) on trust for the estate of Chantal;\n(b) the Defendants were to provide a detailed account of all the transactions which had taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys within 14 days from the date of judgment;\n(c) the Defendants were to account to Baker the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, and Baker was at liberty to trace and recover the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, if necessary. The Defendants had to pay Baker all sums due to Baker on the taking of the account of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys;\n(d) the parties were at liberty to apply to the court for any orders or directions in relation to the taking of accounts of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys;\n(e) Weber was to pay to Baker CHF9.5m plus interest at the rate of 3% per annum calculated from the date the sum of CHF9.5m was loaned to Weber to the date of judgment and the post judgment interest rate of 5.33% calculated from after the date of judgment until the said sum of CHF9.5m plus interest was repaid;\n(f) the sum of US$10,330,658.91, which was paid by Renslade (HK) into court pursuant to SIC/ORC 2/2020 dated 11 January 2020, was to be released to Baker and/or his solicitors; and\n(g) the Defendants were to pay Baker the costs of the action.\n9 By CA/CA 76/2020 (\"CA 76\"), the Defendants appealed against the Suit 3 Judgment. The appeal was dismissed on 19 January 2021.[2]With reference to the Suit 3 Judgment, the Court of Appeal stated: \"We agree with the comprehensive judgment of the court below. In our view, we see no reason to disturb any of the findings made therein, or the orders made.\" (see Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others [2022] 3 SLR 103 (the \"ASI Judgment\") at [24])\nThe ASI Judgment and ASI Appeal\n10 After Baker sued the Defendants in Singapore in November 2017, on 8 August 2019, BCS sued Baker and BCS Pharma corporation (\"BCS Pharma\") - one of Chantal's US companies - in California (the \"Californian Proceedings\"). In the Californian Proceedings, BCS alleged, inter alia , that Baker and BCS Pharma had interfered with the contractual relationship between BCS and Nu Skin (the \"Initial Complaint\"). By agreement, BCS, Baker, and BCS Pharma thereafter agreed to a stay of the Californian Proceedings pending the outcome of the Defendants' appeal against the Suit 3 Judgment, ie , CA 76, and the Californian Proceedings were stayed on 30 June 2020. As mentioned, CA 76 was dismissed on 19 January 2021. On 26 March 2021, the stay on the Californian Proceedings was lifted. On 16 June 2021, Baker applied by SIC/SUM 37/2021 (\"SUM 37\") for an ASI to restrain the prosecution of the Californian Proceedings. On 19 November 2021, the SICC granted the ASI against the Defendants by way of the ASI Judgment.\n11 BCS filed various versions of its Complaint which set out its claim in the Californian Proceedings (the full details of which may be found in the ASI Judgment at [29]-[42] and BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others v Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) [2023] 1 SLR 1 (the \"ASI Appeal\") at [27]-[28]):\n(a) on 8 August 2019, BCS filed its Initial Complaint;\n(b) on 27 April 2021, BCS filed a \"First Amended Complaint\";\n(c) on 27 August 2021, BCS filed a \"Second Amended Complaint\"; and\n(d) on 7 April 2022 (after the ASI was issued on 19 November 2021), BCS filed a \"Third Amended Complaint\".\n12 In the ASI Judgment, the SICC found as follows (at [91]):\n... many of the claims pursued by BCS in the Californian Proceedings amount to an attempt at relitigating matters already decided by this court, and thus vexatious and oppressive and amount to an abuse of process. We also find that BCS's claims are vexatious and oppressive towards the Estate. Moreover, these claims relitigating the same issues that have been decided by this court amount to a collateral attack of this court's Judgment ... This justifies the issuance of an ASI against BCS, to restrain BCS from relitigating the subject-matter of the Suit against the Estate and the US Defendants through the Californian Proceedings.\n13 The SICC thus issued the ASI, in the following terms:\n(1) [BCS] is hereby restrained, whether acting by itself, its officers, its servants or agents or otherwise, from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings under Case No. 2:19-cv-06914-JWH-JPR [ie , the Californian Proceedings], commenced by [BCS] in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in the United States of America on 8 August 2019, against [Baker], both in his individual and personal capacity and as well as his capacity as the Executor of the Estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased, and against [BCS Pharma], Heika Burnison (\"Heika\"), Birka Burnison (\"Birka\"), Grey Pacific Labs, LLC (\"Grey Pacific Labs\") and Grey Pacific Science, Inc (\"Grey Pacific Science\"), insofar as such proceedings relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her estate (\"Estate\"), and any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020 .\n(2) [BCS] shall not be restrained in Case No. 2:19-cv-06914-JWH-JPR, commenced by [BCS] in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in the United States of America on 8 August 2019, from pursuing claims against [Baker], BCS Pharma, Heika, Birka, Grey Pacific Labs and Grey Pacific Science for claims against [Baker] for allegedly holding himself out as an officer of [BCS] or for signing of the assignment agreement transferring the trademark rights, and the settlement agreement with Nu Skin, and for claims against Heika, as an officer of Grey Pacific Labs, for allegedly willingly entering into the assignment agreement for the trademark rights knowing that [Baker] is not an officer of [BCS], or for claims related thereto, provided always that they do not relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her Estate, and any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020.\n(3) [BCS] and [Renslade (HK)] are hereby restrained, whether acting by themselves, their officers, their servants or agents or otherwise , and [Weber] is hereby restrained, whether acting by himself, his servants or agents or as a director, officer or servant or agent or shareholder of [BCS] and [Renslade (HK)] or otherwise , from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings in the United States of America or anywhere else in the world against [Baker], whether in his personal capacity and/or his capacity as the Executor of the Estate, Heika and/or Birka, insofar as any such proceedings relate to the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust in the Ethocyn Rights and assets held on behalf of [Chantal] and now, her Estate, and any issues relating to the reliance on and/or assertion of the said Trust or any issues litigated before the Singapore Courts in SIC/S 3/2018, the Judgment dated 29 April 2020 and CA/CA 76/2020 .\n(4) Costs are awarded to [Baker] to be borne by the Defendants, jointly and severally...\n(5) There shall be liberty to apply, and generally.\n[emphasis added]\n14 We refer to the claims that BCS, Weber, and Renslade (HK) were injuncted by the ASI from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute in the Californian Proceedings, as the \"Injuncted Claims\".\n15 By CA/CA 70/2021 (\"CA 70\"), the Defendants appealed against the ASI Judgment. The appeal was dismissed on 21 September 2022. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal stated (ASI Appeal at [28]) that the claims made under the Second and Third Amended Complaints could essentially be grouped into four categories:\n(a) the \"Intercepted Payment Claims\";\n(b) the \"Trademark Claims\";\n(c) the claim in judicial estoppel; and\n(d) the \"Wrongful Settlement Claims\".\n16 The Court of Appeal found (ASI Appeal at [61] and [63]) that \"the claim in judicial estoppel was in substance raised and decided in Suit 3\" and that \"the claim in judicial estoppel pursued by BCS in the Californian Proceedings amounts to an undermining of the key findings in the Suit 3 Judgment as regards the existence and enforceability of the Trust.\"\n17 The Court of Appeal stated (ASI Appeal at [87]):\nWe agree with the assessment of the SICC that BCS's pursuit of the Intercepted Payment Claims as well as part of the Trademark Claims also amounts to a relitigation of the issues as regards the existence and enforceability of the Trust which were determined in Suit 3. It follows that this would also undermine the Suit 3 Judgment on these key findings.\n18 As for the Wrongful Settlement Claims, the Court of Appeal agreed with the SICC that those claims were not raised and therefore not strictly decided in Suit 3 (ASI Appeal at [42] and [89]), but commented that \"it remains open to [Baker] to assert in the Californian Proceedings that the Wrongful Settlement Claims ultimately relate to the Ethocyn Rights that belong to [Baker] or the Estate\" (ASI Appeal at [89]).\n19 The Court of Appeal thus upheld the ASI, stating: \"[i]n the light of our decision, the [Defendants] are to take steps to withdraw from the Californian Proceedings the claims which are within the ambit of the ASI [ie , the Injuncted Claims].\" (ASI Appeal at [94])\n20 BCS, however, did not do so.\nFindings\nWhether BCS and Weber had committed contempt\n21 BCS and Weber did not file any reply affidavits to oppose the contempt application against them, other than an affidavit from a US lawyer representing BCS in the Californian Proceedings seeking to explain why certain statements made by him (BCS's US lawyer) during the Californian Proceedings did not amount to admissions of breach of the ASI. Nor did BCS and Weber put forward written or oral submissions to dispute that they had committed contempt. Their submissions are only on the potential punishment for contempt: they contend that a fine would be appropriate for both BCS and Weber, ie , that Weber should not be punished with imprisonment.\n22 BCS and Weber clearly knew of the ASI: they appealed against it. It is also clear that the ASI had been breached in that the Injuncted Claims had not been withdrawn from the Californian Proceedings, but were continuing to be prosecuted there. As the Court of Appeal noted in the ASI Appeal, the ASI was breached in that three Injuncted Claims that were in the Second Amended Complaint of 27 August 2021 (prior to the ASI of 19 November 2021) were retained in the Third Amended Complaint of 7 April 2022 (after the ASI), namely: the \"Intercepted Payment Claims\", the part of the \"Trademark Claims\" within the ASI, and the claim in judicial estoppel.\n23 Despite the dismissal of CA 70, the Court of Appeal calling on the Defendants \"to take steps to withdraw from the Californian Proceedings the claims which are within the ambit of the ASI\" (ASI Appeal at [94]), and Baker's lawyers' demand for compliance the next day (22 September 2022), BCS and Weber continued to prosecute the Injuncted Claims in the Californian Proceedings.\n24 Instead, BCS proposed to file a Fourth Amended Complaint which would still not withdraw the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings. In BCS's motion for leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint, filed on 25 January 2023, BCS acknowledged that it had not complied with the ASI, and that the proposed Fourth Amended Motion would still not comply with the ASI. BCS stated in its Memorandum of Points and Authorities:[3]\nUltimately, however, it became apparent that to amend the pleadings in this case so as to fully comply with the Singapore injunction would be to surrender important rights that [BCS] seeks to vindicate in this case. [BCS'] claims, in significant part, depend on contesting the Singapore orders' conclusion ... that a trust existed. [BCS] is not able to comply fully with the anti-suit injunction while protecting its rights under California and federal law.\n25 BCS was saying that it had not complied with the ASI, and that it would not do so.\nContempt by BCS\n26 Under s 4(1)(a) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \"AJPA\"), \"[a]ny person who intentionally disobeys or breaches any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court ... commits a contempt of court.\"\n27 We find that BCS committed contempt of court as set out in Baker's Statement of Committal dated 7 February 2023, in that BCS intentionally disobeyed (or breached) the ASI.\nContempt by Weber\n28 We find that Weber too had committed contempt of court. He was the owner and controller of BCS, and (as Sianto states in his affidavit) Weber was the one instructing US lawyers on the conduct of the Californian Proceedings.[4]Weber was named in the ASI and expressly restrained \"whether acting by himself, his servants or agents or as a director, officer or servant or agent or shareholder of BCS and Renslade (HK) or otherwise, from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute proceedings in the United States of America\" against Baker and others, in respect of the Injuncted Claims (above at [13]). We find that Weber committed contempt of court as set out in Baker's Statement of Committal dated 7 February 2023, in that Weber intentionally disobeyed (or breached) the ASI.\nPunishment for contempt under the AJPA - BCS and Weber\n29 Under s 12(1)(a) of the AJPA, a person who commits contempt of court shall be liable to be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with both.\n30 Baker seeks a fine of at least $70,000 in relation to BCS, and imprisonment for a term of at least 12 months for Weber. BCS and Weber submit that a fine would be appropriate, ie , that Weber should not be punished with imprisonment.\nPreliminary point - relevance of matters after the Statement of Committal which sets out the alleged contempt\n31 We found BCS and Weber to have committed contempt as set out in the Baker's Statement of Committal dated 7 February 2023. In determining punishment , however, Baker says it is relevant to also consider the continuing conduct of BCS and Weber after the date of the Statement of Committal, whereas BCS and Weber contend that the court should not look beyond the Statement of Committal.\n32 There are three aspects to BCS's and Weber's subsequent conduct that are potentially relevant to a determination of the appropriate punishment:\n(a) first, the breach of the ASI continues, in that BCS and Weber have not withdrawn the Injuncted Claims but continue to prosecute them in the Californian Proceedings;\n(b) second, on 14 July 2023, BCS filed an application in the Californian court for an ASI (the \"US ASI\") to enjoin Baker from prosecuting this very contempt application or otherwise enforcing the (Singapore) ASI - that US ASI application was heard on 11 August 2023 and dismissed on 5 September 2023; and\n(c) third, on 24 July 2023, BCS filed an ex parte application in the Californian court for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") in the same terms as its US ASI application - that TRO application was dismissed on 26 July 2023.\n33 BCS and Weber cite Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao [2016] 3 SLR 1 (\" Mok Kah Hong \") at [61] for the proposition that the statement of committal filed pursuant to O 52 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (the \"ROC 2014\"), which sets out the grounds for the application for leave to apply for an order of committal, \"serves a crucial role in enabling the respondent to know the case that has been put forth against him. It also functions as the boundaries of the applicant's case, such as to prevent the applicant from relying on grounds that have been omitted from the statement.\" In finding that BCS and Weber had committed contempt, we did not go beyond Baker's Statement of Committal - it was unnecessary for us to do so. It does not, however, follow that conduct beyond the Statement of Committal is irrelevant to the question of punishment :\n(a) First, the proposition stated in Mok Kah Hong at [61] is not an absolute one - in the same paragraph, the Court of Appeal recognised that, pursuant to O 52 r 5(3) of the ROC 2014, the court may give the applicant leave to rely on grounds other than those set out in the statement of committal.\n(b) Second, as the Court of Appeal held in Tay Kar Oon v Tahir [2017] 2 SLR 342 at [44], \"[i]t follows from the principle that the court has the power to order committal on its own motion that the court must also have the power to grant an order for committal on matters not within an O 52 r 2(2) statement (or indeed, when there is no O 52 r 2(2) statement).\" The court may, on its own motion, pursue an allegation of contempt not contained in an applicant's contempt statement (O 52 r 4 of the ROC 2014).\n(c) Third, conduct occurring after a statement of committal is filed may constitute aggravating or mitigating circumstances relevant to the court's decision on punishment for contempt. In STX Corp v Jason Surjana Tanuwidjaja [2014] 2 SLR 1261 at [85], the court considered a contemnor's lack of requisite deference in respect of the court orders binding him, as \"demonstrated in the nonchalant manner in which he responded to questioning during cross-examination\" during the committal proceedings. In Wang Xiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another [2021] SGHC 282 at [31], the court likewise considered the contemnor's conduct in the contempt proceedings. In PT Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others [2018] 4 SLR 828 (\" Sandipala \") at [83], the court looked at events occurring after the breaches of the relevant court orders, for the purposes of assessing whether the contemnors had taken steps to mitigate and/or purge their contempt, and found that they had not shown any genuine remorse or taken real and substantial steps to address the breaches. See also Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 822 at [92] where the Court of Appeal recognised that facts not set out in the statement of committal can be considered as part of the background facts for the charges that are made out when it comes to considering the appropriate sentence for those charges.\n34 BCS's and Weber's subsequent conduct is therefore relevant to the question of punishment for their contempt. This conduct was squarely put in issue by Baker's evidence and submissions, and BCS and Baker filed an affidavit from BCS's US lawyer that addressed the US ASI application and TRO application. BCS and Baker were accorded, and took, the opportunity to address their subsequent conduct.\nPunishment for contempt under the AJPA - BCS\n35 We consider that the circumstances in the present case justify a higher fine than the $70,000 fine imposed in WestBridge Ventures II InvestmentHoldings v Anupam Mittal [2022] SGHC 270 (\" WestBridge \"). We discuss this in greater detail in the next section. We impose a fine of $80,000 against BCS.\nPunishment for contempt under the AJPA - Weber\n36 For Weber, the key issue is whether he should be punished with imprisonment, or whether a fine would suffice. The court in Sembcorp Marine Ltd v Aurol Authony Sabastian [2013] 1 SLR 245 (\" Aurol \") framed the issue as follows (Aurol at [67]):\nThe various factors taken into account for a custodial sentence are different ways of answering one question: Is a fine adequate to punish and deter contemptuous behaviour? The nature of that behaviour, the motives for it, and the ameliorative and deterrent effect of a fine are all relevant factors.\n37 In the same case, the court listed various (non-exhaustive) considerations (Aurol at [68]), including the nature of the contemptuous act. In that regard, the court will consider to what extent the contemptuous act was egregious; and in assessing the gravity of the act, the court will consider the purpose of the order breached and the impact of that breach on that purpose.\n38 Baker cited the English decision in Mobile TelecommunicationsCo KSC v HRH Prince Hussam Bin Abdulaziz Au Saud [2018] EWHC 3749 (Comm) (\" Mobile Telecommunications \") where a 12-month term of imprisonment was imposed for breach of an ASI. The court recognised the importance of ASIs; they are, in many ways, just as important as freezing orders, they seek to preserve the rights of claimants who have valid dispute resolution clauses and may have valid awards of judgments, and if ASIs are broken, that is a most serious matter and in many respects just as serious as a breach of a freezing order.\nContemptuous breaches of anti-suit injunctions are to be treated for sentencing purposes as analogous to breaches of freezing injunctions. In both cases a breach of the court's order is a serious attack on the administration ... As the Court of Appeal emphasised in McKendrick [Financial Conduct Authority v McKendrick[2019] 4 WLR 65], the inherent seriousness of a breach of a freezing order is such that it is likely that nothing other than a prison sentence will be sufficient to punish it ... Similar considerations apply in my view to serious breaches of an anti-suit injunction.\n40 The gravity of a breach of a freezing order is well accepted in Singapore. In Technigroup Far EastPte Ltd and another v Jaswinderpal Singh s/o Bachint Singh and others [2018] 3 SLR 1391 (\" Technigroup \"), the court stated at [110]:\nDeliberate and substantial breaches of the disclosure provisions of a freezing order tend to be treated as a serious matter because any subsisting non-disclosure increases the risk that assets may be dissipated without accountability, which in turn undermines the very purpose of a freezing order and the other party's ability to satisfy his claim. For this reason, such a breach normally attracts an immediate custodial sentence (JSC BTA Bank v Solodchenko (No 2) [2012] 1 SLR 350 at [51]).\n41 In that case, the court imposed a term of four months' imprisonment on the first and second defendants, suspended for four weeks to give them a final opportunity to fully comply with their discovery obligations (under the specific discovery orders in that case).\n42 In OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others [2005] 3 SLR(R) 60, the court imposed imprisonment terms of six months for (among other things) breaches of a freezing order in relation to disclosure of assets and accounting for expenditure.\n43 In BTS Tankers Pte Ltd v Energy & CommodityPte Ltd and others [2021] SGHC 58, the court imposed imprisonment terms of seven months and five months, respectively, on the two contemnors, for breach of disclosure obligations under freezing orders, but suspended those for seven days to give them an opportunity to comply.\n44 Weber, however, contends that we should not follow the English cases (like Mobile Telecommunications) in drawing an analogy between breaches of an ASI and breaches of a freezing order. Weber submits that in those English cases, imprisonment is viewed as a matter of first resort, whereas it is recognised in Singapore that imprisonment for contempt is usually a matter of last resort (Sandipala at [68]; Technigroup at [104]; Mok Kah Hong at [96]; WestBridge at [165]).\n45 We reviewed the English cases in the manner stated in Mok Kah Hong (at [105]), ie , not for sentencing benchmarks, but for factors taken into consideration by the court in deciding on the appropriate sentence.\n46 The English cases could not be distinguished in the way Weber suggested: the English cases were not decided based on imprisonment being a matter of first resort. Thus, in Mobile Telecommunications , the court considered whether there was any practical alternative to imprisonment (at [33]), and in Dell the court expressed the sentences of imprisonment imposed as being \"necessary\" (at [18], [21], and [24]); in both decisions, the court was mindful of imposing the shortest period of imprisonment necessary (Mobile Telecommunications at [33]; Dell at [18], [21], and [24]).\n47 As a matter of principle, we agree with the observations in the English cases that breaches of ASIs are analogous to breaches of freezing orders. An ASI seeks to protect a claimant's rights to have its dispute decided in the appropriate forum, and to protect the eventual judgment where that has been entered (as it has in the present case). An ASI is similar in purpose to a freezing order, both seek to protect a claimant from being deprived of the fruits of successful litigation. Moreover, the Court of Appeal held in its CA 70 judgment (ASI Appeal at [53] and [54]) that the issuance of the ASI was justified on two jurisdictional bases: first, to prevent an abuse of the forum court's process, or the need to protect the processes, jurisdiction or judgments of the forum court; and second, to halt vexatious and oppressive conduct, in that it would also be vexatious and oppressive to Baker for BCS to seek to relitigate in the Californian Proceedings matters which were already decided between them in the Suit 3 Judgment and in CA 76. The fact that a final and unappealable judgment had already been entered, which BCS and Weber continue to seek to undermine in the Californian Proceedings, makes their contempt even more serious.\n48 Besides seeking to distinguish the English cases, Weber relies on WestBridge , where the court had considered a fine to be the appropriate punishment for the breach of an ASI in that case (at [169]).\n49 The court in WestBridge , however, noted that the appropriate punishment for contempt is fact specific: it \"will depend on the facts of the individual case and the nature of the contempt\" (WestBridge at [166]). The court agreed with the decision in Aurol (at [67]) that \"the underlying question is whether a fine would be adequate to punish and deter contemptuous behaviour\" (WestBridge at [166]).\n50 The court's reasons for not imposing a punishment of imprisonment in Westbridge were expressed as follows (at [169]):\nApplying these factors [set out at [167] - [168]], in my judgment, a fine would be appropriate in this case. While I accept that the defendant's breaches are deliberate and continuing, this feature does not automatically justify or necessitate an imprisonment term (at least in this case). Most of the other grounds for a custodial sentence are not engaged - for instance, the defendant has not previously been found to be in contempt of court, be it for breach of the interim ASI granted in ORC 1463 or otherwise. Neither has the plaintiff shown that a fine would be any less of a deterrent than a term of imprisonment, particularly for a contemnor resident abroad like the defendant.\n51 Various differences with the facts in Westbridge may be noted.\n52 First, Weber is not \"resident abroad\" like the contemnor in Westbridge : in 2002 Weber obtained permission to work in Singapore, and since 2003 he has been a permanent resident of Singapore - as noted in the Suit 3 Judgment (at [2]).\n53 Weber did not put forward any evidence or even submit that he was no longer resident in Singapore, albeit holding permanent residency status here. It appears that Weber still has a place of residence here, at which service was attempted. Moreover, Weber recently (on 2 May 2023) took over from Sianto as the sole director of BCS, and s 145(1) of the Companies Act requires every company to have at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore. Weber's taking office as BCS's sole director was a representation that he was ordinarily resident in Singapore.\n54 To a contemnor like Weber who is ordinarily resident in Singapore, a term of imprisonment can have a greater deterrent value than a fine.\n55 Second, the conduct in the present case was more active than that in Westbridge . Although the contemnor in Westbridge did not withdraw proceedings as required by the ASI, he did not seek to expedite their resolution either, but kept the prohibited proceedings alive by repeatedly adjourning them. Furthermore, by the time the court came to deal with the contempt, the proceedings were still pending (see WestBridge at [14] and [59]-[60]). Here, BCS and Weber:\n(a) amended the Complaint in the Californian proceedings after the ASI had been ordered, in a manner which retained the Injuncted Claims in the earlier Complaint;\n(b) applied for a US ASI on 14 July 2023 to enjoin Baker from prosecuting this contempt application or otherwise enforcing the (Singapore) ASI - that US ASI application was heard on 11 August 2023 and dismissed on 5 September 2023 (above at [32(b)]); and\n(c) applied ex parte on 24 July 2023 for a TRO in the same terms as its US ASI application, which TRO application was dismissed on 26 July 2023 (above at [32(c)]).\n56 In Mok Kah Hong at [110], the Court of Appeal noted that the imposition of a higher sentence would be warranted \"in cases where the alleged contemnor acts in contumelious disregard of the judgment or order and makes no attempt whatsoever to effect compliance, or worse still, takes positive steps to frustrate the effect of the order of court.\"\n57 The applications for the US ASI and US TRO struck at the (Singapore) ASI against BCS and Weber, and the present contempt application to enforce it. Moreover, BCS and Weber sought an early decision by the Californian court on those applications in the hope of pre-empting the Singapore contempt hearing. The Californian court did indeed decide those applications before the Singapore contempt hearing, but those applications were decided against BCS and Weber.\n58 In Westbridge , the contemnor had earlier sought an anti-enforcement injunction (\"AEI\") from the foreign court in relation to an interim Singapore ASI issued against him. After the Singapore court granted a permanent ASI (which was the relevant court order for the contempt proceedings in WestBridge), he then amended the reliefs sought in the injuncted foreign proceedings (including the AEI) to refer to the permanent ASI. This was a contumacious and persistent breach that was orchestrated to undermine or ignore the effect of the Singapore ASI However, the contemnor did not press those reliefs to a decision by the foreign court prior to being held in contempt in Singapore (see WestBridge at [11]-[19], [150]-[153], and [175]). Concomitantly, Baker and the others protected by the ASI have been prejudiced in terms of the time, trouble, and expense of responding to the active steps taken by BCS and Weber in the Californian Proceedings, besides having to face the ongoing risk of an adverse outcome in the Californian Proceedings. The ASI was issued on 19 November 2021 (above at [10]), and by the time of the hearing before us on 6 September 2023, some 20 months had elapsed, but BCS and Baker remained recalcitrant and persisted in their disobedience.\n59 Third, the ASI in Westbridge protected pending proceedings , but the ASI here was issued when the Singapore proceedings in Suit 3 had already culminated in judgmenton the merits (ie , the Suit 3 Judgment, which had moreover been upheld by the Court of Appeal in CA 76 on 19 January 2021, before the ASI was issued). In the present case, the ASI protects the unappealable substantive determination in the Suit 3 Judgment, but there was no equivalent in Westbridge .\n60 Fourth , the contempt proceedings in Westbridge took place at a time when the ASI there was under appeal (see WestBridge at [1] and [59]), whereas here, the contemnors' appeal against the ASI had already been dismissed in CA 70. In Westbridge , the court's comment (at [176]) on the pending appeal against the ASI there, was that the contemnor had not evinced that he was opposed to ever complying with the ASI (for example, persisting in disobedience even following an unfavourable outcome in his appeal against the ASI). Here, the contemnors have continued to disobey the ASI despite their appeal against the ASI having failed in CA 70, and despite the Court of Appeal calling on them to comply with the ASI (ASI Appeal at [94]). That is aggravating conduct. Moreover, it is clear from what was said in the motion for leave to file BCS's Fourth Amended Complaint (see [24]-[25] above) that the contemnors acknowledged that they had not complied with the ASI, but also said that they would not do so.\n61 Fifth, Weber procured BCS to breach the ASI. Procuring others to commit the contemptuous act is an aggravating factor (see Aurol at [68(h)]). Not only was Weber the owner and controller of BCS, and the one instructing BCS's US lawyers, but Weber also replaced Sianto as the sole director of BCS for the purposes of furthering the contempt. On 2 May 2023, Sianto expressed his view to Weber that the Injuncted Claims should be withdrawn from the Californian Proceedings and that BCS's US lawyers should be instructed to do so as soon as possible. Weber responded by taking Sianto's place as BCS's sole director the very next day.[5]\n62 Having regard to the above, the contempt in the present case is more serious than that in Westbridge .\n63 We also had regard to the factors listed by the Court of Appeal in Mok Kah Hong (on contempt by disobedience in the matrimonial context) at [105]-[110], which Steven Chong J (as he then was) who delivered the judgment in Mok Kah Hong summarised as follows in Technigroup (at [106]): \"(a) a degree of continuity in the contemptuous conduct, taking into account the past conduct of the contemnor; (b) the impact of the contemptuous conduct on the other party; (c) the nature of the non-compliance, in particular whether it was intentional or fraudulent on the part of the contemnor; and (d) any genuine attempts on the part of the alleged contemnor to comply with the judgment or order.\" As Chong J stated (Technigroup at [107]), those factors were equally relevant and instructive in cases of contempt in commercial contexts.\n64 In the present case:\n(a) there is continuity in the contemptuous conduct in that BCS and Weber have persistently disobeyed the ASI - not only have the Injuncted Claims not been withdrawn from the Californian Proceedings, but BCS and Weber also took active steps to seek to undermine the Suit 3 Judgment as well as these contempt proceedings;\n(b) BCS's and Weber's conduct has prejudiced Baker and the other parties protected by the ASI - not only is there an ongoing risk of an outcome in the Californian Proceedings at odds with the Suit 3 Judgment, Baker and others have had to incur time, trouble, and expense in responding to the contemnors' actions in the Californian Proceedings;\n(c) the non-compliance was clearly intentional on the part of BCS and Weber, done in the knowledge that they were disobeying the ASI, and motivated by financial gain; and\n(d) there were no attempts whatsoever by BCS and Weber to comply with the ASI, and indeed their statements to the Californian court were to the effect that they would not comply with the ASI.\n65 Nevertheless, we have decided not to impose a term of imprisonment against Weber, primarily because - for all of BCS's and Weber's efforts in breach of the ASI - they have failed to obtain from the Californian court any decision in their favour: the TRO application was dismissed, the US ASI application was dismissed, and the Injuncted Claims are still pending. The Californian court has made no decision against the Suit 3 Judgment, the (Singapore) ASI, or these contempt proceedings. By way of contrast, in Mobile Telecommunications , the foreign proceedings that were continued in breach of an ASI had resulted in an adverse foreign judgment (Mobile Telecommunications at [9]-[10]), and an imprisonment term was imposed for the contempt.\n66 In the circumstances, we impose on Weber the maximum fine of $100,000.\n67 For completeness, we considered whether the penalties against BCS and Weber should be suspended, although they did not submit that this should be done, and there was no suggestion that they would comply with the ASI if given \"one last chance\". Having regard to BCS's and Weber's conduct of cynically disobeying the ASI for a period of some two years, taking active steps in the meantime to attack the ASI and the present contempt proceedings, our decision is that the fines we have imposed should not be suspended.\nWhether a director disqualification order was available against Weber\n68 Besides seeking a penalty under the AJPA against Weber, Baker also applied by SUM 22 to amend his contempt application in SUM 9 to seek a director disqualification order against Weber, ie , an order under s 154 of the Companies Act disqualifying Weber from acting as a director, or taking part (whether directly or indirectly) in the management of a company.\n69 Section 154 of the Companies Act provides in material part as follows:\nDisqualification to act as director on conviction of certain offences\n154.x(1) A person is subject to the disqualifications provided in subsection (3) if x\n(a) the person is convicted of any of the following offences:\n(i) any offence, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, involving fraud or dishonesty punishable with imprisonment for 3 months or more;\n(ii) any offence under Part 12 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001, where the conviction was on or after 1 July 2015; or\n(b) the person is subject to the imposition of a civil penalty under section 232 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 on or after 1 July 2015.\n(2) The court may, in addition to any other sentence imposed, make a disqualification order against any person who is convicted in Singapore of any of the following offences:\n(a) any offence in connection with the formation or management of a corporation;\n(b) any offence under section 157 or 396B;\n(c) any offence under section 237 or 239 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018.\n(3) Subject to any permission which the Court may give pursuant to an application under subsection (6), a person who x\n(a) is disqualified under subsection (1); or\n(b) has had a disqualification order made against him or her under subsection (2),\nmust not act as a director, or take part (whether directly or indirectly) in the management of a company, or of a foreign company to which Division 2 of Part 11 applies, during the period of the disqualification or disqualification order.\n70 Baker contends that our finding that Weber had committed contempt of court by disobeying the ASI means that Weber has been \"convicted [of an] offence in connection with the formation or management of a corporation\" under s 154(2)(a); Weber contends to the contrary.\n71 At common law, contempt by intentional disobedience of a court order is regarded as civil contempt: Tan Beow Hiong v Tan Boon Aik [2010] 4 SLR 870 (\" Tan Beow Hiong \") at [23]-[25]; Li Shengwu vAttorney-General [2019] 1 SLR 1081 (\" Li Shengwu \") at [57] and [61], commenting on Moh Kah Hong . The issue is whether such contempt is an \"offence\" for the purpose of s 154 of the Companies Act, as that term is used in that section. However, the Companies Act does not itself define the term \"offence\" as used in that section.\n72 Baker relies on the definition of an \"offence\" under s 2(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \"CPC\"): \"an act or omission punishable by any written law\". As a person found liable for contempt may be punished by imprisonment and/or a fine, Baker submits that Weber has committed an \"offence\" for the purposes of s 154 of the Companies Act.\n73 The CPC does not, however, purport to define \"offence\" where that term is used in other statutes ; the definition of \"offence\" in s 2(1) of the CPC is, like the other definitions, for the purposes of interpreting phrases used \"[i]n this Code, unless the context otherwise requires\". Thus, the definition of \"offence\" in the CPC is expressly for the purposes of the CPC itself, and even so, that definition only applies \"unless the context otherwise requires\". Subjecting contempt cases to the full application of the CPC would go against the Court of Appeal's decision in Li Shengwu which recognised that civil procedure and processes have always been used to establish jurisdiction over any contemnor, whether the contempt complained of was civil contempt or criminal contempt (at [115]-[121]).\n74 The AJPA itself only makes limited express provision for the application of the CPC. Specifically, other than in relation to investigations under s 22 of the AJPA, the AJPA does not provide for the application of the CPC - under ss 23 and 24 of the AJPA:\n(a) the Attorney-General may authorise a police officer to exercise, for the purposes of investigations unders 22 , powers in relation to police investigation under Part 1 of the Schedule to the CPC;\n(b) for the purposes of any such investigation under s 22, the provisions of Part 2 of the Schedule to the CPC apply \"as if the alleged contempt were an arrestable offence\"; and\n(c) statements made to a police officer in the course of any such investigation are admissible as evidence in accordance with ss 258 or 259 of the CPC.\nSection 22 investigations involve scandalising contempt (under s 3 of the AJPA) or the intentional causation or abetment of contempt by a non-party (under s 4(8) of the AJPA). Civil contempt by disobedience under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not a basis for the application of the CPC under ss 23 and 24 of the AJPA.\n75 Moreover, applying the CPC definition of \"offence\" to that term as used in the Companies Act would mean that where a person is subject to the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \"SFA\") (which allows for disqualification under s 154(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1967), that would amount to him being convicted of an offence (which might allow for disqualification under s 154(1)(a), or (2)(a), (b), or (c), as the case may be). However, the Companies Act itself draws a distinction between conviction of any offence under Part 12 of the SFA (governed by s 154(1)(a)(ii) of the Companies Act) and a person being subject to the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA - which is within Part 12 of the SFA (governed by s 154(1)(b) of the Companies Act). Furthermore, if, as Baker contends, \"offence\" under s 154(1)(a) means \"an act or omission punishable by any written law\", that too would cover civil penalty cases under the SFA; and it would have been unnecessary for the legislature to have amended s 154 of the Companies Act to specifically cover such civil penalty cases by way of s 154(1)(b).\n76 In the context of s 154 of the Companies Act, we thus do not accept that the imposition of a civil penalty under s 232 of the SFA means there has been a conviction of an offence under the Companies Act - the Companies Act draws a distinction between the two, and indeed so does the SFA.\n77 In Tan Liang Joo John v Attorney-General [2020] 5 SLR 1314 (\" Tan Liang Joo \") the court found that criminal contempt would fall within the concept of \"offence\" under Art 45(1)(e) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (the \"Constitution\"), but expressly left open the position regarding civil contempt because of its potentially different nature: see Tan Liang Joo at [11] and [29]. Under Art 45(1)(e) of the Constitution, a person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament if they have been convicted of an offence by a court in Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to a fine of not less than $2,000, and has not received a free pardon.\n78 In arriving at its decision, the court in Tan Liang Joo noted the use of the word \"offence\" in another Article of the Constitution, Art 35(8), which states: \"[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.\" The court stated that the term \"offence\" in Art 35(8) includes criminal contempt, and noted that there was force in the argument that the same word is to bear the same meaning throughout a particular statute (Tan Liang Joo at [36]).\n79 The present case involves civil contempt by intentional disobedience of a court order pursuant to s 4(1) of the AJPA. These proceedings have been initiated by Baker, not by the Attorney-General. Under s 30(1) of the AJPA, no proceedings for contempt of court as defined in s 3 (scandalising contempt) or s 4(8) (the intentional causation or abetment of contempt by a non-party) may be instituted except by or with the consent of the Attorney-General, but such consent is not necessary for proceedings for contempt under s 4(1) of the AJPA. This is an indication that civil contempt by disobedience of a court order under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not regarded as an \"offence\" for the purposes of the AJPA, and should not be so regarded for the purposes of disqualification under the Companies Act.\n80 A further indication is found in s 4(4) of the AJPA, which provides that: \"[s]ubject to subsections (5), (6) and (7), any contempt of court referred to in subsection (1) or (2) may be waived by the aggrieved party and such waiver relieves from liability the person who commits the contempt\". Section 4(5) gives the court the discretion to disallow such waiver of contempt of court in prescribed circumstances. However, the fact that contempt under s 4(1) can be waived, relieving the erstwhile contemnor of liability, also suggests that s 4(1) contempt is not an \"offence\" for the purposes of the AJPA, and should not be so regarded for the purposes of the Companies Act.\n81 There are also authorities predating the enactment of the AJPA to the effect that civil contempt is not an offence. In Tan Beow Hiong , the court stated (at [23]-[24]):\n... it is fairly clear that breach of a coercive (ie, prohibitory or mandatory) court order or judgment is a civil contempt (see the speech of Lord Oliver in Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd [1992] 1 AC 191 at 217), and does not amount to a criminal offence ...\n... the better view is that, as The Law of Contempt [Nigel Lowe and Brenda Sufrin, Borrie & Lowe: The Law of Contempt (Butterworths, 3rd Ed, 1996)] states at p 662:\n[C]riminal contempt is, for all its peculiarities, a crime, whereas a civil contempt despite its criminal characteristics is not.\n82 Tan Beow Hiong was cited in Maruti Shipping PteLtd v Tay Sien Djim and others [2014] SGHC 227 (\" Maruti Shipping \") (at [134]), for the proposition that \"[d]espite its quasi-criminal nature, a civil contempt does not amount to a criminal offence\". Thus, the court in Maruti Shipping doubted whether the court had the power, in a case of civil contempt, to exercise any power under Part XVII of the CPC to impose a community sentence, such as a Mandatory Treatment Order or probation.\n83 Section 154(2)(a) of the Companies Act requires that the director be \"convicted\" of an \"offence\". The term \"convicted\" is also found in Art 45(1)(e) of the Constitution, and this was considered in Tan Liang Joo (at [33]), where the court said:\nAs for the reference to a conviction in Art 45(1)(e), this could point to a narrow meaning. However, the term \"convict\" has always been used in relation to criminal contempt, specifically for the offence of contempt by scandalising the court: see, eg , AG v Shadrake Alan [2011] 2 SLR 445 at [137]; Au Wai Pang v AG [2016] 1 SLR 992 at [9].\n84 As the present case is concerned with civil contempt, we considered that use of the word \"convicted\" in s 154(2)(a) does point to a narrow meaning, ie , that a person found to have committed civil contempt, in particular contempt by intentionally disobeying a court order, has not thereby been \"convicted\" of an \"offence\".\n85 Ultimately, the question before us is whether a finding of civil contempt by intentional disobedience of a court order under s 4(1) of the AJPA is a \"conviction\" for an \"offence\" for the purposes of potential disqualification under s 154 of the Companies Act. For the above reasons, our conclusion is that a finding of such civil contempt is not a \"conviction\" for an \"offence\" in that context. For avoidance of doubt, we leave open the question of whether other types of contempt - in particular, criminal contempt - might be regarded differently, as this issue is not before us.\n86 Accordingly, we dismiss SUM 22, and we do not make a director disqualification order against Weber.\nWhether Sianto had committed contempt\n87 Baker also seeks a finding of contempt and consequent sanctions against Sianto, a former director of BCS.\n88 Sianto was a director of BCS from 5 March 2019 to 3 May 2023:\n(a) from 5 March 2019 to 30 September 2019, Sianto was a director together with Weber;\n(b) from 30 September 2019 to 21 September 2022, Sianto was a director together with one Chuah Lay San (\"Chuah\");\n(c) from 21 September 2022 to 3 May 2023, Sianto was the sole director; and\n(d) from 3 May 2023 (after Sianto ceased to be a director) Weber has been the sole director of BCS.\n89 When the ASI was issued on 19 November 2021, the directors of BCS were Sianto and Chuah. However, it is undisputed that Weber solely owned and controlled BCS, and it was Weber who instructed BCS' US lawyers in relation to the Californian Proceedings.\n90 On 28 September 2022, Baker's lawyers wrote to Sianto enclosing a copy of the ASI together with a penal notice informing him that if BCS neglected to obey the ASI, Sianto as a director of BCS would be liable for contempt for the purpose of compelling BCS to obey the ASI. The letter informed Sianto that BCS had not withdrawn the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings and demanded that Sianto procure BCS's full compliance with the ASI by noon on 5 October 2022, failing which contempt proceedings might be commenced against him.\n91 Sianto says that he forwarded Baker's lawyers' letter and enclosures to Weber and BCS's US lawyers and requested that they look into Baker's demand. Sianto says that his expectation was that they would consider if there was basis for the demand, and if so, that Weber would have BCS take steps to comply with the demand. Sianto acknowledges, however, that he did not expressly state that expectation to Weber or the lawyers.\n92 On 13 March 2023, Baker's lawyers wrote again to Sianto, this time enclosing the SUM 9 contempt application and related documents. Sianto says that after considering the documents, he informed Weber that he was of the view that BCS should withdraw the claims in the Californian Proceedings that were prohibited by the ASI (above at [61]). Sianto says that he asked Weber for Weber's urgent confirmation that Weber would be instructing BCS's US lawyers to carry out the withdrawal of the Injuncted Claims as soon as possible. Sianto says that he told Weber that he would otherwise not be in a position to continue being a director of BCS and that he would resign. Weber asked Sianto to resign as a director and so Sianto did.\n93 Sianto exhibited in his affidavit his email of 2 May 2023 to Weber, in which Sianto said:\nI am of the view that BCS should withdraw the claims in the Californian action that are prohibited under the ASI soonest possible. Can you please confirm urgently that you will be instructing the lawyers to do the withdrawal as soon as possible? Otherwise, I would not be in the position to continue my position as director of BCS and will have no choice but to resign as director of BCS.\n94 Weber promptly replied to Sianto the same day to say, \"[a]s you know Baker is a [criminal] and has created [with] his lie a big damage to me and BCS. I can not accept that. In any case I understand you and please resign as Director from BCS And replace it [with] me. Sorry if this [legal] case create you any problem.\"\n95 On 3 May 2023, Sianto resigned as a director of BCS with immediate effect, and he was replaced with Weber as BCS's sole director.\n96 Baker seeks a finding of contempt against Sianto under s 6(2) of the AJPA, on the basis that Sianto was an officer of BCS (a corporation which had committed contempt) who \"knew or ought reasonably to have known\" that BCS's contempt was being committed, and had, at the very least, \"failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of that contempt of court\" as stipulated in s 6(2)(b)(iii) of the AJPA.\n97 Sianto contends that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent or stop BCS' commission of contempt, but that Weber had nevertheless persisted in maintaining the Injuncted Claims in the Californian Proceedings, a matter which was outside his control.\n98 Sianto says he first became aware of Suit 3 sometime in May 2018, and of CA 70 (BCS's appeal against the ASI Judgment), sometime around December 2021. He says he cannot recall when he first learnt of the Californian Proceedings, but he knew that Weber wanted to pursue legal action against Baker in America. Sianto also says he was aware that BCS had failed in Suit 3, SUM 37 (which resulted in the ASI), CA 76 (against the Suit 3 Judgment), and CA 70 (against the ASI Judgment), and that Weber wanted to continue with the Californian Proceedings.\n99 From what Sianto says, we are satisfied that he was aware of the ASI - at least by December 2021 when he became aware of CA 70 which was BCS's appeal against the ASI Judgment. It does not, however, follow that Sianto was aware that BCS had not complied with the ASI, prior to him receiving Baker's lawyer's letter of 28 September 2022 informing him of this, together with a copy of the order and a penal notice. Although Sianto says he knew Weber wanted to continue with the Californian Proceedings, the ASI did not require BCS to withdraw the Californian Proceedings, but only the Injuncted Claims.\n100 Bearing in mind that the burden is on Baker to establish contempt beyond reasonable doubt, we find it is not proven that Sianto knew, prior to the 28 September 2022 demand letter from Baker's lawyers, that BCS had disobeyed the ASI. On a related note, under O 45 r 7(4) of the ROC 2014, it is generally a prerequisite for enforcement of an order by contempt proceedings that a copy of the order with a penal notice be served on the person to be committed - Sianto only received that on 28 September 2022.\n101 Prior to that date, it was not unreasonable for Sianto and Chuah - as directors of BCS - to let Weber (the owner and controller of BCS) instruct BCS's US lawyers, and for them as directors to have expected Weber to have procured BCS's compliance with the ASI.\n102 When Sianto received the 28 September 2022 demand letter, he says he forwarded it to Weber and BCS's US lawyers requesting that they look into the demand, expecting that - if there were basis for the demand - Weber would have BCS comply with the demand. Baker contends that we should not accept Sianto's evidence on this, because Sianto has not produced the communication by which he forwarded the demand letter to Weber and BCS's US lawyers. However, Baker issued no notice requiring Sianto to produce that communication (as Baker might have), nor did Baker apply for Sianto to be cross-examined on his affidavit. We accept Sianto's evidence as to his response to the demand letter.\n103 We also accept Sianto's evidence (in this regard substantiated by documents) as to his response to the letter of 13 March 2023 which was accompanied by the SUM 9 contempt application and other documents - that he expressed his view to Weber that BCS should withdraw the Injuncted Claims from the Californian Proceedings or Sianto would resign; and that Sianto promptly did resign and was replaced by Weber.\n104 We find that Baker has not established that Sianto \"failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent or stop the commission of [BCS's] contempt of court\" under s 6(2)(b)(iii) of the AJPA. Baker submits that Sianto ought to have done more, such as directly instructing BCS's US lawyers to withdraw the Injuncted Claims. We do not, however, believe that would have been effective: if Sianto in his capacity as BCS's director had purported to countermand Baker's instructions, we expect Baker in his capacity as BCS's owner would simply have removed Sianto and taken his place as BCS's sole director, and reiterated his instructions to BCS's US lawyers to maintain the Injuncted Claims. In essence, that is what happened, save that Sianto resigned rather than was removed.\n105 For completeness, on the evidence before us, we do not find that Sianto \"consented or connived, or conspired with others, to effect the commission of the contempt of court\" under s 6(2)(b)(i) of the AJPA or that he is \"in any other way, whether by act or omission, knowingly concerned in, or is party to, the commission of the contempt of court by the corporation\" under s 6(2)(b)(ii).\n106 In the circumstances, we find that Baker has not established any of the grounds under s 6(2)(b) of the AJPA for holding Sianto in contempt as a director of BCS, in relation to BCS's contempt. The contempt application against Sianto is thus not made out.\nConclusion\n107 For the above reasons, our decision is as follows:\n(a) BCS is in contempt of court and we impose a fine of $80,000;\n(b) Weber is in contempt of court and we impose a fine of $100,000;\n(c) SUM 22 is dismissed as our finding of civil contempt against Weber under s 4(1) of the AJPA is not a conviction of an offence for the purposes of s 154 of the Companies Act, such that a director disqualification order could be made against Weber; and\n(d) we do not find Sianto to be in contempt of court.\n108 Unless the parties can agree on costs, they shall file and serve written submissions on the appropriate costs orders to be made (both as to incidence and quantum), limited to ten pages (excluding any schedule of disbursements), within 21 days.",

Defendant\njudgment\n[Arbitration x Award x Recourse against award x Setting aside]\n1 This case concerns an application by the claimant to set aside the Partial Award dated 10 February 2023 (the \"Award\") made in an arbitration (the \"Arbitration\") under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \"ICC\"), pursuant to s 24(b) of the International Arbitration Act 1994 (2020 Rev Ed) (\"IAA\") and/or Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (\"Model Law\"), as incorporated under s 3 of the IAA, on the ground that the arbitral process that led to the Award was in breach of the rules of natural justice.\n2 For the reasons that follow, I find that there was no breach of natural justice in the process that led to the making of the Award and so dismiss the application.\nIntroduction\n3 On 15 March 2017, at the request of the claimant, the defendant provided the claimant with a technical proposal (the \"Technical Proposal\") for the design, engineering and supply of a 300 \"tonnes crushed per day\" (\"TCD\") raw sugar plant (the \"Sugar Plant\").\n4 On 30 April 2017, the claimant entered into two agreements. First, a contract with a third-party company, hereinafter referred to as \"X Company\", for the \"design engineering and supply\" of the Sugar Plant (the \"Sugar Plant Contract\"). Secondly, a contract with the defendant (the \"Agreement\") for the supply, amongst other things, of a 0.5MW turbine (the \"0.5MW Turbine\").\n5 On 26 August 2020, the claimant commenced the Arbitration against the defendant. In the Arbitration, the claimant contended that, pursuant to the Agreement, the defendant was required to supply a turbine that was sufficient to meet the power required for the running and operation of the Sugar Plant and/or to supply what it had contracted to supply, that is, a turbine capable of generating 500KW (or 0.5MW) of power. The claimant's case in the Arbitration was that, in breach of the Agreement, the defendant failed to do so.\n6 The jurisdiction of the tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") was challenged by the defendant, and, on 16 July 2021, the Tribunal issued a Jurisdiction Award (the \"Jurisdiction Award\") determining that it had the jurisdiction to continue with the Arbitration. Thereafter, between August 2021 and September 2021, the parties submitted their respective cases. The hearing took place over seven days between 27 June 2022 and 1 July 2022. Four witnesses were called by the claimant, one of whom was its expert. The defendant called two to testify: its witness and an expert.\n7 On 10 February 2023, the Tribunal rendered the Award dismissing all of the claimant's claims. Thereafter, on 15 May 2023, the claimant commenced this present application. The claimant submits that the Tribunal acted in breach of the fair hearing rule of the rules of natural justice, as it had disregarded a substantial portion of the evidence, submissions and arguments raised by the claimant in finding that:\n(a) The defendant had not undertaken to provide sufficient power for all the electrical needs of a 300 TCD sugar plant but just the sugar-producing operations (Award at [70]);\n(b) There was \"no doubt\" that the defendant did supply the equipment it had contracted to supply, ie , the 0.5MW Turbine (Award at [90]);\n(c) The defendant had provided sufficient evidence to show that the equipment supplied was actually reasonably fit for purpose (Award at [122(11)]);\n(d) The claimant had not produced reliable technical data or documents to support its allegations of inadequacies in the design or supply of the 0.5MW Co-Generation Plant (ie , the 0.5MW Turbine) (Award at [122(11)]); and\n(e) The claimant has not produced any scientific or technical evidence that the Sugar Plant had not been running satisfactorily and/or could not have been doing so if there were no additional works and no upgrading or expansion (Award at [122(14)]).\nPrinciples to be applied\n8 Article 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law provides that an arbitral award may be set aside where \"the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case\".\n9 In BZW and another v BZV [2022] 1 SLR 1080 (\" BZW \"), the Court of Appeal stated that in order for the court to set aside an arbitral award on grounds of breach of natural justice, the following four elements must be present (at [59]):\n(a) First, the specific rule of natural justice that was breached.\n(b) Second, how it was breached.\n(c) Third, how the breach was connected to the making of the award.\n(d) Fourth, how the breach prejudiced the respondent's rights.\n10 In relation to the fair hearing rule, the Court of Appeal in BZW explained (at [60]) that there were two ways in which this rule can be breached:\n(a) One, a breach of the fair hearing rule can arise from a tribunal's failure to apply its mind to the essential issues arising from the parties' arguments. ...\n(b) Two, a breach of the fair hearing rule can also arise from the chain of reasoning which the tribunal adopts in its award. To comply with the fair hearing rule, the tribunal's chain of reasoning must be: (i) one which the parties had reasonable notice that the tribunal could adopt; and (ii) one which has a sufficient nexus to the parties' arguments (JVL Agro Industries ([29] supra) at [149]). A party has reasonable notice of a particular chain of reasoning (and of the issues forming the links in that chain) if: (i) it arose from the parties' pleadings; (ii) it arose by reasonable implication from their pleadings; (iii) it is unpleaded but arose in some other way in the arbitration and was reasonably brought to the party's actual notice; or (iv) it flows reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or is related to those arguments (JVL Agro Industries at [150], [152], [154] and [156]). To set aside an award on the basis of a defect in the chain of reasoning, a party must establish that the tribunal conducted itself either irrationally or capriciously such that \"a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award\" (Soh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (\" Soh Beng Tee \") at [65(d)]).\n[emphasis in original]\n11 On the requirements that the breach must be connected to the making of the award and that the breach must have caused prejudice, it was stated in Bagadiya Brothers (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Ghanashyam Misra & Sons Pte Ltd [2023] 4 SLR 984 (at [42]) that the applicant must demonstrate that, as a result of the breach, \"the arbitrator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations\"; or put another way, that \"the material could reasonably have made a difference to the arbitrator\" (JVL Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd [2016] 4 SLR 768 at [194], citing L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal [2013] 1 SLR 125 at [54]).\n12 I also observe that, as regards the requirement of prejudice, the Court of Appeal in BZW said (at [63]):\n... A breach of natural justice causes a party to suffer actual or real prejudice if complying with the rules of natural justice could reasonably have made a difference to the outcome of the arbitration (see L W Infrastructure ([35] supra) at [54]) ... It is not necessary for us to hold that giving proper consideration would have caused the Tribunal to find in the respondent's favour on both claims. The prejudice arising from the failure to consider the submissions which arguably could have succeeded is sufficient.\nThe claimant's case\n13 The claimant submits that, whilst the Tribunal stated in the Award that it had considered all \"submissions, documents and evidence\" from the parties, the Tribunal did not in fact do so, given the various documentary and witness evidence which the Tribunal failed to address and which arguably would have led the Tribunal to reach a different outcome in the Award, particularly in relation to the following issues:\n(a) whether the 0.5MW Turbine was to provide all the power needs for the Sugar Plant;\n(b) whether the defendant had supplied what it had contracted to do; and\n(c) the spare parts claim.\nWhether the 0.5MW Turbine was to provide all the power needs for the Sugar Plant\n14 The Tribunal found that the defendant had not undertaken to provide for all the electrical needs of the entire Sugar Plant other than for the sugar-producing (and/or jaggery-producing) operations of the Sugar Plant (Award at [57]-[71]).\n15 In doing so, the claimant contends that the Tribunal failed to address the following documents, evidence and arguments raised by it. First, it says that the Tribunal failed to address the Technical Proposal which set out the technical specifications of the Sugar Plant and was created and put forward by the defendant. The claimant says that the Technical Proposal was incorporated into the Agreement, and it refers to the recital which states:\nWHEREAS, the SELLER has agreed to supply and the CLIENT has agreed to purchase from the former, the Machinery 0.5 mw Co-generation Plaint [sic] and balance of Plant, as per the specifications mentioned in the Technical Proposal with all the necessary procurement, fabrication, assembly supervision, testing at workshop, at CIF ... basis, as per terms and conditions, which follow and form part of this Contract.\n16 It also refers to the part of the Technical Proposal which stipulated that the 0.5MW Turbine was to have a maximum continuous rating of 6 tons per hour (\"TPH\") and that the turbo alternator set was to have a power capacity of 0.5MW at 0.8 power factor. If the 0.5MW Turbine was not intended to meet the full needs of the entire Sugar Plant, the claimant says that the Technical Proposal would have identified the potential shortfalls in power generation or specified other means or methods of supplementing power, but it did not do so.\n17 Secondly, the claimant refers to email and WhatsApp correspondence between the claimant and defendant prior to entering into the Agreement and prior to finalising the Technical Proposal which indicated that a 300 TCD sugar plant would require a 0.5MW turbine. In particular the claimant refers to:\n(a) An email dated 7 December 2016 (timed at 2.34pm), in which the defendant agreed to provide a 300 TCD plant with a 6 TPH boiler and 0.5MW turbine. At the time, it was contemplated that the defendant would be supplying the entire Sugar Plant. If the 0.5MW Turbine was insufficient for the needs of a 300 TCD plant, then the claimant says that the defendant would have stated this; but the defendant did not do so.\n(b) Subsequent emails dated 14 December 2016 (timed at 11.37am) and 15 December 2016 (timed at 8.58am), in which the defendant sent the \"final specs\" and \"final technical offer\" for the 300 TCD plant which confirmed the supply of a 0.5MW turbine.\n(c) A WhatsApp message to the claimant on 16 January 2017 stating that the defendant was \"almost done with the basic engineering of the 300 tcd plant\". The claimant says that this message makes clear that what went into the Technical Proposal was entirely from the defendant and hence it was the defendant's proposal or representation that the 0.5MW Turbine would be sufficient for the purposes of the Sugar Plant.\n18 Thirdly, the claimant refers to invoices issued by the defendant to the claimant which stated that the 0.5MW Turbine was being supplied for a \"300 TCD Sugar Project\". Taken in the broader context of all the earlier discussions between the parties and the Technical Proposal, the claimant submits that these invoices further affirm that the Sugar Plant only required a 0.5MW Turbine and support the claimant's position that at all relevant times, the parties were collectively labouring under the clear understanding that the equipment being supplied was meant to cater to the needs of the entire Sugar Plant.\n19 Fourthly, the claimant submits that, as gleaned from several extracts of the transcript, the defendant's representative agreed during cross-examination that if the Sugar Plant had been installed according to the Technical Proposal, the 0.5MW Turbine was in fact intended to supply enough power for the Sugar Plant. Given that the Agreement expressly incorporates the Technical Proposal put forward by the defendant, the claimant contends that this confirms that the 0.5MW Turbine was intended to supply all the power needs of the Sugar Plant.\n20 Fifthly, the claimant says that during cross-examination, the defendant's representative accepted that the Technical Proposal was tailor made for the claimant's requirements. On this point, while the defendant's witness refused to accept that this meant that the 0.5MW would suffice for the needs of a 300 TCD sugar plant, the claimant argues that his responses were illogical and to be disbelieved.\n21 Sixthly, the defendant had solicited and obtained an acceptance certificate dated 15 May 2019 (the \"Acceptance Certificate\") from the claimant stating that the defendant had \"designed, manufactured, supplied, erected and commissioned our Organic Sugar Plant\". The claimant says that this certificate, the draft of which was produced by the defendant, was an implicit, if not explicit acceptance that the power generation provided by the defendant was intended to be sufficient for the purposes of the Sugar Plant.\n22 On this basis, the claimant submits that had the Tribunal addressed the above evidence tendered by it, the Tribunal could have come to a different view as to whether the defendant had undertaken that the 0.5MW Turbine would meet the entire power needs of the Sugar Plant, which in this case, as was undisputed, it did not.\nWhether the defendant supplied what it had contracted to do\n23 The claimant submits that the Tribunal inexplicably found that the defendant had in fact supplied what it had contracted to supply, a 0.5MW Turbine. This, the claimant submits, stands in stark contrast with the Tribunal's observations at [101(1)] and [120(a)] of the Award that there was evidence that the 0.5MW Turbine was not able to achieve 0.5MW. It refers to the Tribunal's full reasoning at [79]-[123] of the Award.\n24 In arriving at its decision, the claimant contends that the Tribunal failed to account for various documents and/or arguments which the claimant raised in its Closing Submissions.\n25 First, the claimant says that there are numerous WhatsApp messages exchanged between the claimant and the defendant where the claimant complained that the Turbine was operating at below capacity and the defendant did nothing to refute those messages. In particular, the claimant constantly highlighted that the 0.5MW Turbine kept stalling when it reached a power output of 400KW and that a safe load for the 0.5MW Turbine was between 300KW and 350KW only, which the defendant never refuted.\n26 Secondly, the claimant refers to emails where the defendant acknowledged the inadequacy of the 0.5MW Turbine or did not refute the inadequacy of the 0.5MW Turbine.\n27 Thirdly, after all the discussions between the parties, a representative of the defendant sent a WhatsApp message to the claimant in which he says \"let us search for a suitable turbine\". The claimant submits that this was as clear an admission as possible from the defendant that the 0.5MW Turbine was not suitable and that is why a search for an alternative turbine was necessary.\n28 Fourthly and most importantly, there is a report from a third party (\"Y Entity\") stating categorically that the 0.5MW Turbine was only capable of generating an average power of 400KW to 425KW, even though what the claimant had contracted for was a turbine that could generate 0.5MW (on the assumption that 0.5MW was sufficient to meet the needs of the Sugar Plant).\n29 The claimant submits that the Tribunal could have come to a different view as to whether the defendant supplied what it had contracted to do - a 0.5MW turbine - if it had considered the above evidence and arguments raised by the claimant. Instead, it says that the Tribunal inexplicably made the finding that the claimant has not produced any scientific or technical evidence that the Sugar Plant has not been running satisfactorily and/or could not have been running unsatisfactorily if there were no additional works and no upgrading or expansion. In support of this point, it refers to [122(14)] of the Award.\n30 The claimant contends that there was no evidential basis for the Tribunal to reach this finding as Y Entity was an independent third party to the Arbitration and its report conclusively found that the 0.5MW Turbine could not generate the requisite power of the Sugar Plant. If the Tribunal found that Y Entity's report was insufficient, then the claimant submits that the Tribunal should have given the claimant an opportunity to lead further evidence and/or make additional submissions before the Tribunal, which could reasonably have made a difference to the Tribunal's finding.\n31 By failing to consider the above evidence, the claimant submits that there was a breach of natural justice, by which the claimant's rights were substantially prejudiced.\nThe spare parts claim\n32 The claimant refers to [179] of the Award in which the Tribunal declined to determine its claim for US$39,437 paid by the claimant to the defendant for spare parts for the Sugar Plant on the basis that the spare parts claim fell outside the purview of the Arbitration Agreement.\n33 The claimant submits that the Tribunal's decision was at odds with the Tribunal's decision in the Jurisdiction Award. The claimant says that the Tribunal had expressly rejected the challenge to its jurisdiction and determined that it had the jurisdiction to continue with the Arbitration (Jurisdiction Award at [94]). However, it submits that the Tribunal has now reversed its position, choosing instead to find that one aspect of the claim falls outside of its jurisdiction.\n34 The claimant submits that the Tribunal's decision to exclude the spare parts claim from the scope of the Arbitration was an outcome of which it neither had notice nor an opportunity to address the Tribunal on the issue. As such, it was prevented from presenting its case on that issue.\nSummary\n35 The claimant submits that nowhere in the Award was there any consideration by the Tribunal of any of the evidence and submissions referred to above and which were fundamental to its claim. By not considering that evidence and submissions, the claimant submits that the Tribunal acted in breach of the rules of natural justice and/or failed to exercise the authority conferred to it by failing to decide the matters submitted to it.\n36 It says that it has been gravely prejudiced because, if the Tribunal had considered its evidence and submissions on these points, such arguments could reasonably have made a difference to the Tribunal, and ultimately the findings in the Award. The claimant contends that the Tribunal's breaches of the rules of natural justice denied it the full effect of the claimant's arguments and evidence, and that these had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to its deliberations.\nThe defendant's case\nWhether the 0.5MW Turbine was to provide all the power needs for the Sugar Plant\n37 The defendant submits that the claimant's submission that the Tribunal had failed to account for various documents and/or arguments from the claimant in finding that the defendant was not required to provide for all the power needs of the Sugar Plant (at a specification of 300 TCD) is opportunistic and an attempt at a \"second bite at the cherry\" which the courts do not condone, referring to Soh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (at [65(b)]).\n38 By picking particular documents and arguments, the defendant says that the claimant has ignored the following other reasons for the Tribunal's finding on this issue:\n(a) At [70(a)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the Agreement did not provide expressly or impliedly that the defendant was to provide sufficient power for all the needs of the Sugar Plant.\n(b) At [70(b)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the claimant itself was unaware, at the time during and after the Agreement, which type of sugar or jaggery the Sugar Plant was to produce. Further, the parties had discussed the possibility of expanding the plant to a 500 TCD plant and 800 TCD plant in the future. The defendant submits that it can scarcely be said that it had to meet the need of a 300 TCD sugar plant when the claimant itself was unsure of what type of sugar and at what capacity the plant was intended to produce.\n(c) At paragraph [70(d)] of the Award, the Tribunal held that the Agreement was for a relatively much smaller sum of US$1,108,800 for the supply of the 0.5MW Turbine compared to US$10,215,000 in respect of the Sugar Plant Contract for the Sugar Plant with a specification of 300 TCD.\n(d) At [70(e)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the claimant has failed or refused to produce Annexure A of the Sugar Plant Contract (for which adverse inferences were made against the claimant) or any other sufficient information which contains the specifications of the equipment supplied by X Company for the Sugar Plant. The defendant says that it was therefore kept from knowing all the specifications of the parts of the Sugar Plant and knowledge of all the power requirements of the Sugar Plant cannot be imputed to the defendant.\n39 Having regard to those findings by the Tribunal, the defendant submits that the Tribunal would not have reached a different conclusion on the issue of whether the defendant was obliged to provide for all the power needs of the Sugar Plant under the Agreement, and the claimant did not suffer any real prejudice as the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings would not have been altered in any case.\n40 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to address the Technical Proposal put forward by the defendant, the defendant says that, to the contrary, it is manifestly clear from the Award that the Tribunal had considered the contents of the Technical Proposal. The Tribunal was aware that the claimant's team had opportunities to review the defendant's proposals before they were finalised as the Technical Proposal of 15 March 2017 and attached to the Agreement. The Tribunal reproduced the contents of the Technical Proposal at [48] of the Award and considered the defendant's scope of works under the Technical Proposal and also the scope of X Company's works. The Tribunal noted, at [50] of the Award, that \"both Parties' respective witnesses accepted at the Hearing that the [defendant] was responsible for the supply of the 6 TPH Boiler and [the 0.5MW Turbine], but the supply of all other plant, machinery and equipment were in the scope of [X Company] [sic]\". The Tribunal also considered the provisions of the Sugar Plant Contract at [49] of the Award. In fact, the \"turbo alternator set\" with \"a power capacity of 500KW at 0.8 factor\" is referred to in the Award (at p 29).\n41 The Tribunal had also noted that from the documents cited by the claimant such as \"the Technical Proposal, the Agreement, the boiler manual and the invoices\", there was an \"association\" of the Sugar Plant with the 0.5MW Turbine at the time of entering the agreement. However, the Tribunal was \"careful\" not to draw conclusions merely from impressions from such \"associations\" but focused on the \"actual agreed terms and conditions of the Agreement between the Parties\".\n42 At [70(c)] of the Award, the Tribunal noted that the claimant's team had opportunities to review the technical proposal before it was finalised and attached to the Agreement. In fact, at [63] of the Award, the Tribunal had delved into considerable detail as to the implications of the fact that the claimant's team had the opportunity to review the Technical Proposal, including the fact that the claimant had ample opportunity to state that a 6 TPH boiler and/or the 0.5MW Turbine would not have been suitable.\n43 The defendant refers to the claimant's reliance on the defendant's witness statement as evidence that the erection of the Sugar Plant was based on the defendant's Technical Proposal. It says that the claimant's team reviewed the Technical Proposal before it was finalised, and the defendant was only responsible for the scope of Annexures III (relating to the 6 TPH boiler) and IV (relating to the 0.5MW Turbine) of the Technical Proposal.\n44 Therefore, the defendant submits that the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to consider the contents of the Technical Proposal is wrong and there is no breach of natural justice in this regard.\n45 In relation to the claimant's submission that the Tribunal failed to \"account for\" various emails and WhatsApp correspondence prior to the entering into the Agreement, the defendant says that this correspondence was exchanged in the context of the entire scope of works being awarded to the defendant. However, the claimant chose to split the scope of the Technical Proposal into two contracts and the defendant was only responsible for the supply of the 6 TPH boiler and the 0.5MW Turbine.\n46 In any event, the defendant says that the Tribunal had, in fact, considered the correspondence which the claimant alleges was disregarded and it refers to [53(c)], [60] and [63] of the Award. In particular, at [53(c)] of the Award, the Tribunal reproduced the email dated 7 December 2016 and clearly recognised that the defendant stated \"our phase 1 will have a 300 TCD plant with 6 TPH AND 0.5 MW turbine [sic]\" in the email. The Tribunal therefore clearly considered the arguments advanced by the claimant. Also, at [63(c)] of the Award, the Tribunal sets out the latter half of the email dated 14 December 2016 which stated: \"[a]ttached are the final specs of 300 TCD and next phase of 500 TCS frozen after consideration all the points from the team and final discussions with [the defendant], Marking a copy to the team to have a final look at the specs [sic]\".\n47 The defendant submits that, therefore, the Tribunal did not fail to consider the relevant correspondence but, rather, the Tribunal was persuaded by the defendant's submissions that the claimant's team had the opportunity to review the defendant's proposals before they were finalised as the Technical Proposal which was attached to the Agreement, as set out in [70(c)] of the Award. The defendant therefore submits that the claimant cannot say that the Tribunal had failed to consider the correspondence between the parties before they entered into the Agreement.\n48 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to consider invoices issued by the defendant stating that the 0.5MW Turbine was supplied for a 300 TCD sugar plant, the defendant says that, again, the Tribunal did not fail to consider the invoices. Rather, the Tribunal considered the invoices but was not persuaded that the invoices evidenced an obligation on the part of the defendant to meet all the power requirements of the Sugar Plant.\n49 At [57(c)] of the Award, the Tribunal set out the claimant's arguments in relation to the alleged invoices and, having considered the invoices, the Tribunal stated at [68(4)] and [68(5)] of the Award that it was careful not to draw conclusions based on mere \"associations\" to a 300 TCD plant in the alleged invoices and that it focused on the \"actual terms and conditions of the Agreement between the Parties\". Given that due consideration was given by the Tribunal to the invoices and the arguments advanced by the claimant relating to those invoices, the defendant submits that there has been no breach of natural justice.\n50 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence from the cross-examination of the defendant's witness, the defendant submits that the claimant has misconstrued the evidence given by that witness when it submits that he agreed that the 0.5MW Turbine was intended to supply power for the entire Sugar Plant. The defendant says that its witness very clearly stated that \"the agreement between [the claimant] and [the defendant] is for a 0.5-megawatt co-generation plant. [T]here's no agreement between [the claimant] and [the defendant] for a 300 TCD Plant\". The defendant submits that the claimant appears to be conflating the Sugar Plant Contract with the Agreement. In fact, the defendant's witness was unable to answer \"a yes or no\" when asked whether the 0.5MW Turbine was supposed to supply power for the entire Sugar Plant, indicating that the defendant was unsure of whether the 0.5MW Turbine was even supposed to satisfy the power requirements of the Sugar Plant to begin with.\n51 Further, the defendant says that its witness testified that the technical specifications were \"tailor made\" for the claimant's requirements which, it submits, supports its arguments that the claimant clearly had the opportunity to review the Technical Proposal.\n52 As a result, the defendant submits that it is unclear how this evidence from its witness's cross-examination provides any conclusive basis for the Tribunal to be able to determine that the 0.5MW Turbine was intended to supply enough power for the Sugar Plant, much less that there was a breach of natural justice.\n53 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to account for the Acceptance Certificate dated 15 May 2019 from the claimant, which stated that the defendant \"designed, manufactured, supplied, erected and commissioned our Organic Sugar Plant\", the defendant says that the Tribunal extensively dealt with this issue at [87]-[89] and [90(4)]-[90(5)] of the Award. The defendant also refers to [89] of the Award where it says that the Tribunal had set out this exact argument of the claimant. The Tribunal therefore did not fail to consider the claimant's arguments in relation to the Acceptance Certificate.\nWhether the defendant supplied what it had contracted to do\n54 The defendant submits that it is pertinent to note the reasons for the Tribunal's finding that the defendant had supplied the equipment it had contracted to supply and was not liable for the alleged problems with the equipment:\n(a) At [122(1)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the defendant's communications with the claimant were not really admissions by the defendant that the problems were due to inadequacies and defects in the defendant's equipment. Rather, the communications were efforts to work together with the claimant to try to resolve the problems with achieving sufficient power for the running of the Sugar Plant.\n(b) At [122(2)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the claimant did admittedly have problems with cane feeding and the provision of bagasse as fuel for the boilers to generate sufficient power for the Sugar Plant. As provided by Clause 3(b) of the Agreement, the claimant was responsible for the provision of raw materials and fuel for the operation of equipment at the plant. The claimant also admitted that they did have constraints on cane feeding for the operation of the power generation equipment, such as availability of sufficient sugar cane, bagasse, wood, and fuel.\n(c) At [122(4)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that the claimant had not produced any reliable technical data or documents (such as log readings of the power generation equipment, amount of cane feeding or other data) to not only support the claimant's own allegations of inadequacies in the design or supply of the defendant's equipment, but also to rebut the suspicions that the equipment supplied by X Company could be over-sized and hence increased the electrical workload of the Sugar Plant, or that the constraints in cane feeding and bagasse contributed to the shortfall in power attained for the operations of the Sugar Plant.\n(d) At [122(5)] of the Award, the Tribunal found that, ultimately, the claimant had not adduced any technical or scientific evidence, or documents and data, to prove their allegations that the problems were due to under-capacity and shortcomings in the defendant's equipment.\n55 While the claimant seeks to cast doubt on the findings of the Tribunal by stating that its findings at [101(1)] and [120] of the Award, that the 0.5MW Turbine was having problems achieving the load of 0.5MW, contradicted the Tribunal's findings at [90] of the Award that the defendant had supplied what it contracted to, the defendant says that the claimant omits reference to several other salient paragraphs in the Award which explain the rationale for the Tribunal's findings at [90] of the Award. The defendant says that the Tribunal had determined at [101(2)] of the Award that the problems with the boiler and the 0.5MW Turbine arose out of a \"mixture\" of reasons. The defendant says that two reasons, in particular, were highlighted by the Tribunal. First, the claimant had cane-feeding problems and insufficient bagasse which led to insufficient fuel for the boiler to generate sufficient power for the Sugar Plant, as reflected in contemporaneous correspondence and admitted in cross-examination by one of the claimant's witnesses. Secondly, there was suspected over-sizing of the equipment supplied by X Company which the claimant was unable to rebut as it failed to produce any reliable technical data or documents (such as log readings of the power generation equipment, amount of cane feeding, or any other data).\n56 Having regard to the Tribunal's findings set out above, the defendant submits that the Tribunal would not have reached a different conclusion on the issue of the defendant's liability, and the claimant did not suffer any real prejudice as the final outcome of the arbitral proceedings would not have been altered.\n57 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to account for various communications between the claimant and the defendant in which it says that the defendant admitted to the inadequacy of the 0.5MW Turbine, the defendant says that they in fact related to future plans to expand the plant and were not made in the context of issues arising out of the supplied equipment. In any event, the defendant says that the Tribunal reproduced at [103(a)] of the Award the claimant's arguments and submissions that the \"[d]efendant [had] admitted problems with the running [of] the boiler\" showing that the Tribunal was aware of and had considered the claimant's argument. The defendant says that the Tribunal had further reproduced the defendant's submission at [105] of the Award and determined that such correspondence referred to finding a solution or probable solution but \"this did not mean or imply that the problem was caused by the [defendant] . \"\n58 The defendant points out that the Tribunal referred to an email dated 18 June 2019 from a representative of the defendant at [109(d)] of the Award and the defendant's submission that the email correspondence showed that \"there were cane-feeding issues on the [c]laimant's side which ought to have been resolved by the [c]laimant, but which the [defendant] was in any case good faith co-operating with and assisting the [c]laimant to resolve\".\n59 After considering the parties' submissions, the Tribunal found at [122(1)] of the Award that the alleged communications between the claimant and the defendant \"were not really admissions\" but \"efforts to work together with the [c]laimant to try to resolve the problems of achieving sufficient power for the running of the 300 TCD Sugar Plant\".\n60 On that basis the defendant submits that the Tribunal did in fact consider the alleged communications between the parties in relation to the problems with the equipment and made a finding which was not in the claimant's favour. As a result, it could not be said that there was any breach of natural justice when the alleged communications and arguments advanced by the claimant were indeed considered by the Tribunal.\n61 In relation to the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to \"account for\" a report from Y Entity, the defendant refers to the context in which the claimant now places reliance on this document. First, it says that there was no representative from Y Entity as a witness in the Arbitration and such reliance on Y Entity's report offended the hearsay rule as it could not be tested by cross-examination. Secondly, the defendant says that the \"report\" was merely minutes of a meeting held between the claimant and Y Entity without the defendant, which occurred on 4 July 2021 after the Arbitration had been commenced on 26 August 2020.\n62 Thirdly, the fact that the minutes of meeting from Y Entity stated that the 0.5MW Turbine \"was only capable of generating average power of 400KW to 425 KW\" was considered by the Tribunal and reproduced in [113(c)] of the Award.\n63 Further, the defendant says that the Tribunal also had the benefit of the expert report of the claimant's expert but found that it could not rely on it owing to various deficiencies, including:\n(a) There was a lack of documentation and data on the technical issues to support his findings, and the limited information provided to him to do his report (Award at [130(b)]).\n(b) The report did not enclose the log readings of the boiler and 0.5MW Turbine (Award at [130(c)]); and\n(c) The claimant's expert admitted that the log readings should have ideally been checked on an hourly basis, but this was also not done. The log readings would have been useful to check and determine the performance of the boiler and 0.5MW Turbine (Award at [130(c)]).\n64 The defendant therefore submits that, by seeking to say that the Tribunal did not consider the \"report\" by Y Entity, the claimant is belatedly trying to rely on the \"report\" even though the Tribunal had determined that it was unable to rely on it owing to its deficiencies.\nThe spare parts claim\n65 The defendant submits that, contrary to the claimant's contention, the Tribunal's decision to decline to determine the spare parts claim was not \"at odds\" with its previous decision in the Jurisdiction Award.\n66 The defendant submits that the claimant has conflated the issues of a claim's jurisdiction and admissibility, which were distinguished in Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Ltd and others v Kingdom of Lesotho [2019] 1 SLR 263 (\" Swissbourgh \") and explained in BBA and others v BAZ and another appeal [2020] 2 SLR 453 (\" BBA \"). The defendant submits that what the claimant argues to be a jurisdictional issue regarding the spare parts claim is actually an admissibility issue and therefore the decision of the tribunal is not reviewable.\n67 The defendant refers to [178(a)] of the Award where the Tribunal cited its decision in its earlier Jurisdiction Award dated 16 July 2021, as follows:\n'The issue of whether the issue of spare parts is part of the Agreement as submitted by the [c]laimant or part of a separate contract as contended by the [defendant]' was 'something not to be decided summarily' at that stage. At that stage, the Tribunal also agreed with the [c]laimant's submission that 'unless there was something in the arbitration agreement that excludes spare parts, these would in the meantime come within the ambit of the arbitration. Final decisions on the factual, contractual and legal merits or demerits of the case are for a later stage.'\n68 The defendant then refers to the Tribunal's decision at [178(b)] and [178(c)] of the Award where the Tribunal said that it had now considered the merits and full arguments of the parties' respective cases:\nHaving perused the Agreement very carefully, as well as the facts concerning the spares, I do not find anything in the Agreement to support the [c]laimant's argument that the [defendant] agreed expressly or impliedly to supply spare parts.\n69 On the basis that only objections targeted at the jurisdiction of the claim and not at the admissibility of the claim are reviewable, the defendant submits that the Tribunal has clearly reviewed the claim and then come to a considered decision that the spare parts claim simply fell outside the scope of the Agreement.\n70 In any event, so far as the claimant's claim based on a breach of natural justice is concerned, the defendant submits that the Tribunal clearly considered parties' arguments and submissions regarding the spare parts claim before coming to its decision at [178] of the Award. The Tribunal specifically detailed the arguments of both parties and determined that the spare parts claim were new transactions and contracts made outside the Agreement. The defendant submits that the Tribunal's finding relates to the admissibility of the spare parts claim which is not reviewable on the authority of Swissbourgh and BBA .\n71 The defendant refers to the fact that on the first day of the hearing, the Tribunal specifically directed parties to address the Tribunal on whether the spare parts claim was part of the Agreement and whether it can be part of the Arbitration. The defendant says that this dispenses with the claimant's contention that the Tribunal's decision to exclude the spare parts claim from the scope of the Arbitration was an outcome of which the claimant did not have notice, or on which the claimant did not have an opportunity to address the Tribunal. Having been directed to address the Tribunal on the spare parts claim, the claimant had an opportunity to present its case. If the claimant failed to do so, it did so to its detriment.\nDiscussion and decision\n72 All three grounds on which the claimant seeks to challenge the Award are based on breach of the rules of natural justice. In relation to those grounds, the claimant says that the Tribunal disregarded and did not consider a substantial portion of the evidence, submissions and arguments raised by the claimant. The claimant in fact limits its case, certainly on the first two grounds, to documentary and witness evidence which it says the Tribunal failed to address and which arguably would have led the Tribunal to reach a different outcome in the Award.\n73 In order to succeed on a claim that the rules of natural justice were breached because the Tribunal failed to consider certain evidence, the claimant would have to show, first, that there was relevant and material evidence which the Tribunal disregarded in coming to its decision. Having done that, the claimant would then have to show that this evidence, when considered in the context of the other evidence on that issue, would arguably have led the Tribunal to reach a different outcome in the Award. It is not sufficient to show that there was some evidence not taken into account. That evidence has to be of such importance that it would arguably have led to a different outcome. As has often been said, a challenge on natural justice grounds is not an opportunity to appeal the Tribunal's findings on fact or law; that is why the evidence must be of critical importance to the outcome in circumstances where the Tribunal has found to the contrary based on the other evidence.\n74 I now turn to consider the three grounds.\nWhether the 0.5MW Turbine was to provide all the power needs of the Sugar Plant\n75 The claimant says, first, that the Tribunal failed to address the Technical Proposal in finding that the defendant had not undertaken to provide for all the electrical needs of the entire Sugar Plant other than for the sugar-producing (and/or jaggery-producing) operations of the Sugar Plant (see [15]-[16] above).\n76 However, it is abundantly clear that the Tribunal did address the Technical Proposal and the claimant's submission based on that document. It cited the Technical Proposal in full at [48] of the Award, including Annexures III and IV which dealt with steam and power generation. In dealing with \"Issue (C)\" which asked \"[d]id the [defendant] undertake that the equipment it provided under the Agreement will meet all the power requirements of the entire 300 TCD Plant?\", the Tribunal set out the submissions of the claimant at [57] of the Award and, in particular at [57(c)], the Tribunal noted the argument, based partly on the Technical Proposal, that the obligation to supply the 0.5MW Plant consisting of a 6 TPH boiler and a 0.5MW turbine must be for the purpose of meeting all the power requirements of a 300TCD Sugar Plant.\n77 There is therefore no basis for the claimant's contention that the Tribunal failed to address the Technical Proposal or the claimant's submissions based on it.\n78 Secondly, the claimant says that the Tribunal failed to consider email and WhatsApp correspondence between the claimant and defendant prior to entering into the Agreement and prior to finalising the Technical Proposal which indicated that a 300 TCD sugar plant would require a 0.5MW turbine. The email correspondence is that of 7, 14 and 15 December 2016 and the WhatsApp message is dated 16 January 2017 (see [17] above).\n79 Again, it is simply not correct that the Tribunal did not consider the emails of 7 and 14 December 2016. The Tribunal cited the email of 7 December 2016 both at [53(c)] and [60(b)] of the Award and the email of 14 December 2016 at [60(c)] of the Award. The email of 15 December 2016 merely forwarded the Technical Offer made by the defendant on 14 December 2016 and the later WhatsApp message of 16 January 2017 merely stated \"[w]e are almost done with the basic engineering of the 300 tcd plant\" which added nothing to the 14 December 2016 reference to a 300 TCD plant.\n80 Thirdly, the claimant says that the Tribunal failed to consider invoices issued by the defendant to the claimant which stated that the 0.5MW Turbine was being supplied for a \"300 TCD Sugar Project\" (see [18] above). Again at [57(c)] the Tribunal refers expressly to these invoices and deals with them at [68(4)] of the Award. There is no basis for this contention.\n81 Fourthly, the claimant says that the Tribunal failed to consider the evidence during the cross-examination of the defendant's witness (see [19] above). The claimant refers to extracts from the transcripts and says that the defendant's witness agreed that if the Sugar Plant had been installed according to the Technical Proposal, the 0.5MW Turbine was in fact intended to supply enough power for the Sugar Plant. I do not so read the transcripts. The first question related to a hypothetical situation where the defendant had supplied a co-generation plant and all the other equipment for a 300 TCD plant; it was in the context of that situation that the defendant's witness accepted that the co-generation plant would have to provide enough power for that plant. The second question was whether the 0.5MW Turbine was supposed to satisfy the power requirements for a 300 TCD sugar plant. The defendant's witness clearly did not agree but said \"it all depends\" and \"[i]t's not a yes or no\". Therefore, the evidence is not to the effect asserted by the claimant and the contention fails on that ground.\n82 Fifthly, the claimant says that the Tribunal failed to consider the defendant witness's evidence, during cross-examination, that the Technical Proposal was tailor made for the claimant's requirements; while he did not accept that it meant that the 0.5MW Turbine would suffice for the needs of a 300 TCD sugar plant, the claimant argues that this was to be disbelieved (see [20] above). I have reviewed the transcript and can find nothing relevant or material to this issue or to lead to the conclusion that the defendant's witness is to be disbelieved.\n83 Sixthly, the claimant says that the Tribunal failed to consider the Acceptance Certificate dated 15 May 2019 from the claimant stating that the defendant had \"designed, manufactured, supplied, erected and commissioned our Organic Sugar Plant\" (see [21] above). Again, the certificate is cited at [87] of the Award, the parties' submissions are set out at [88] and [89] of the Award and the Tribunal set out its conclusions on those submissions at [90(4)] and [90(5)] of the Award. There is therefore no basis whatsoever for the contention that Tribunal failed to consider the Acceptance Certificate.\n84 Therefore, this ground fails on the initial premise because all the relevant and material evidence was, in fact, considered by the Tribunal. However, even if that had not been the case, the Tribunal's conclusion at [70] of the Award that \"it was not provided, expressly or impliedly, in the Agreement\" that the defendant would provide sufficient power for all the electrical needs for the entire 300 TCD Sugar Plant was a matter of contractual interpretation, and there was nothing in this evidence which would arguably have altered this conclusion or the other conclusions of the Tribunal on this issue.\n85 It follows that this ground fails.\nWhether the defendant supplied what it had contracted to do\n86 The claimant says that the Tribunal inexplicably found that the defendant had supplied what it had contracted to supply when it accepted at [101(1)] and [120(a)] of the Award that there was evidence that the 0.5MW Turbine was not able to achieve 0.5MW (see [23] above).\n87 In arriving at its decision, the claimant contends that the Tribunal failed to account for various documents and/or arguments which the claimant raised in its Closing Submissions (see [24] above). However, it is important to distinguish between two points. The first point is whether the boiler/turbine combination achieved 0.5MW as to which the Tribunal found that \"there were indeed problems with regard to the boiler and turbine achieving a load of 0.5 MW for the 300 TCD Sugar Plant\" in [101(f)] and [120(a)] of the Award, as the claimant points out (see [23] above). The second point is why it did not achieve a load of 0.5MW.\n88 As the defendant points out (see [54] above), the Tribunal's findings in [122] of the Award went to the issue of why the problems with the Sugar Plant were not the defendant's responsibility. First, the Tribunal said that the communications between the parties were not admissions that the problems were due to inadequacies and defects in the defendant's equipment but efforts to work together with the claimant to try to resolve the problems of achieving sufficient power for the running of the 300 TCD Sugar Plant (Award at [122(1)]). Secondly, that the claimant had problems with cane feeding and provision of bagasse as fuel for the boilers to generate sufficient power for the Sugar Plant (Award at [122(2)]). Thirdly, that the claimant had not produced any reliable technical data or documents (such as log readings of the power generation equipment, amount of cane feeding or other data). This was needed not only to support the claimant's own allegations of inadequacies in the design or supply of the defendant's equipment, but also to rebut the suspicions that the equipment supplied by X Company could be over-sized and hence increased the electrical workload of the plant, or that the constraints in cane feeding and bagasse contributed to the shortfall in power being attained for the operations of the Sugar Plant (Award at [122(4)]). Ultimately, the Tribunal found that the claimant has not adduced any technical or scientific evidence nor any documents nor data to prove their allegations that the problems were due to under-capacity and shortcomings in the defendant's equipment (Award at [122(5)]).\n89 It is in that context that the contentions of the claimant have to be considered.\n90 First, the claimant says that there were numerous WhatsApp messages exchanged between the claimant and the defendant where the claimant complained that the Turbine was operating below capacity and highlighted that the 0.5MW Turbine kept stalling when it reached a power output of 400KW, and that a safe load for the 0.5MW Turbine was between 300KW and 350KW only, which the defendant never refuted (see [25] above). This goes to the first point on which the Tribunal found there were problems in achieving 0.5MW.\n91 Secondly, the claimant refers to emails where the defendant acknowledged the inadequacy of the 0.5MW Turbine or did not refute the inadequacy of the 0.5MW Turbine (see [26] above). The Tribunal referred to emails of 17 and 18 June 2019 at [92] of the Award and these went, again, to the first point, the problems in achieving 0.5MW.\n92 Thirdly, the claimant refers to the WhatsApp message sent by a representative of the defendant, in which he says, \"let us search for a suitable turbine\" (see [27] above). The claimant submits that this was a clear admission that the 0.5MW Turbine was not suitable. The Tribunal, however, considered communications between the parties and held that they were not admissions that the problems were due to inadequacies and defects in the defendant's equipment but efforts to work together with the claimant to try to resolve the problems of achieving sufficient power for the running of the 300 TCD Plant.\n93 Fourthly, the claimant refers to and relies on a report from Y Entity stating that the 0.5MW Turbine was only capable of generating an average power of 400KW to 425KW not 500KW (see [28] above). This again goes to the first point. In any case, this was referred to by the Tribunal at [113(c)] of the Award and there can be no suggestion that the Tribunal failed to consider the document.\n94 Further it is clear that the claimant is now putting great emphasis on this document because the Tribunal rejected the evidence of its expert (Award at [130] and [132]). The Tribunal also rejected the evidence of the defendant's expert but stated at [131(a)] that the only useful part of his report was on the technical issue of \"[w]hether the Steam Turbine supplied by [the defendant] is able to generate power of 0.5 MW\", where he said:\nFrom the records available in the said Arbitration Proceedings, as the Boiler was under-utilised by [the claimant], the required steam to be supplied to the Steam Turbine could not be generated and thus the Steam Turbine was unable to generate the power of 500 KW. Unless the fuel (bagasse/wood) is available to operate the Boiler at its full capacity, no steam can be generated and thus the required power of 500 KW cannot be achieved.\n95 It therefore is clear that the document relied on by the claimant as a \"report\" of Y Entity is very much promoted as evidence because the expert evidence on which the claimant had sought to rely was rejected, about which no complaint is or could be made.\n96 As the defendant states, the \"report\" is, in fact, minutes of a meeting held between the claimant and Y Entity on 4 July 2021 (see [61] above). It reports results of a trial but does not contain details of why lower power was achieved. Given the position on expert evidence, there is nothing in this which would be relevant or material to the establishing the cause of the lower power.\n97 Therefore, having reviewed the documents relied on by the claimant, it is clear that the emails and WhatsApp messages were either considered by the Tribunal and dealt with in [122(2)] of the Award, or were instead relevant to the issue of whether the 0.5MW Turbine in fact achieved 0.5MW and not the question of what caused the lower output. Y Entity's report was also considered by the Tribunal but went, again, only to the power output not the cause of that power output.\n98 Accordingly, the claimant has not made out a case that the Tribunal failed to take account of relevant or material documents or that those documents would arguably have affected the outcome, given the Tribunal's reasoning. On that basis, this ground for challenge fails.\nThe spare parts claim\n99 Whilst the defendant makes a point that the Tribunal's decision to exclude the spare parts claim from the Arbitration cannot be challenged on the basis of jurisdiction as it goes to admissibility (see [66]-[69] above), the basis for challenge by the claimant is not a lack of jurisdiction but a failure to comply with the rules of natural justice.\n100 The claimant says that in the light of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Award, its decision to exclude the spare parts claim from the scope of the Arbitration was an outcome of which it had no notice and which it could not address, and that it was so prevented from presenting its case (see [34] above).\n101 That contention cannot stand in the light of the transcript of the first day of the hearing where the Tribunal expressly raised these points:\nOn the matter of spares, although that's a relatively smaller part of the claims, there have been submissions by the parties, so one part that stands out in my mind is, are the claim for spares -- can they be part of this arbitration or not? Because, firstly, one question is whether they are part of the agreement. The next question is whether or not they are part of the agreement, can they be part of the arbitration? So you have to look at the arbitration clause closely to answer this.\n102 On this basis, this completely defeats the claimant's case that the Tribunal's decision to exclude the spare parts claim from the Arbitration was an outcome of which it had no notice and which it could not address, and that it was so prevented from presenting its case. It was expressly raised by the Tribunal and the claimant was given the opportunity to deal with the point.",

        "text": "In the Singapore international commercial court\nof the republic of singapore\n[2024] SGHC(I) 5\nOriginating Application No 10 of 2023\nBetween\n... Applicants\nAnd\n... Respondent\njudgment\n[Arbitration - Costs]\n1 Judgment in these proceedings was given on 15 November 2023: DBX and another v DBZ[2023] SGHC(I) 18. The Applicants were ordered to pay the Respondent's costs. The parties were unable to agree on the amount of the costs. I have received the Respondent's written submissions on costs and the Applicants' submissions in reply. This is the determination of the amount of the costs.\n2 When the proceedings were transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court (\"the SICC\"), the learned Deputy Registrar directed that the costs regime under O 21 of the Rules of Court 2021 (\"the ROC\") and Appendix G to the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (\"the Costs Guidelines\") should apply to the assessment of pre-transfer costs, and the costs regime under O 22 of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 (\"the SICC Rules\") should apply to the assessment of post-transfer costs.\n3 The Respondent claims: (a) costs of $187,000, made up of $65,000 for pre-transfer costs, $115,000 for post- transfer costs and $7,000 for preparation of the costs submissions; and (b) disbursements of $7,709.38 and HKD151,978.26, the latter amount being the costs of instructing its Hong Kong law expert, Mr Stephen Tisdall. The Applicants respond with amounts of $16,288 for pre-transfer costs and $45,000 for post-transfer costs; they do not take issue with the amount of $7,000 for preparation of the costs submissions nor the amounts for disbursements.\nPre-transfer costs\n4 There is substantial agreement on the basis for assessment of the pre-transfer costs.\n5 The successful party is entitled to \"a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably incurred\" (O 21 r 22(2) of the ROC). Whether costs were reasonably incurred is assessed objectively by considering whether the costs were incurred in a way corresponding to the level of effort that is generally accepted as being likely to be expended for the particular type of work in question; whether costs are a reasonable amount is also assessed objectively by considering whether the overall amount corresponds to the level of costs generally accepted as being likely to be incurred for the particular type of dispute: Senda International Capital Ltd v Kiri Industries Ltd [2023] 1 SLR 96 (\" Senda \") at [50]. The objective standard is because costs awarded under O 21 of the ROC are assessed \"at such a level as would enable a litigant with reasonable merits to pursue justice\", so that the level of recoverable costs in each case is \"shaped by the normative question of what ought to be the amount of costs a successful party can recover for the particular work done in the context of the dispute in question, irrespective of the level of costs the successful party may have actually incurred in the legal proceedings\" [emphasis in original] (Senda at [47]).\n6 In its assessment of pre-transfer costs, the court is guided by the factors in O 21 r 2(2) of the ROC, and by costs precedents and the Costs Guidelines; the regard to costs precedents tends to awarding the same levels of costs in similar or comparable cases, while the Costs Guidelines represent the level of fees which members of the public and the legal profession would generally accept as reasonable (Senda at [48]-[49]). But these are guides only, and the court may depart from the Costs Guidelines or apply an uplift if, guided by the factors in O 21 r 2(2), the circumstances of the case so warrant (Senda at [14]; CBX and another v CBZ and others [2022] 1 SLR 88 at [28] and [34]).\n7 The indicative range in the Costs Guidelines for a full day arbitration Originating Application is $13,000 to $40,000.\n8 Without saying what figure within the range it takes as the starting point, the Respondent submits that an uplift is warranted. The Respondent's submissions are extensive, and I summarise their principal points. The matter was complex (two awards, four discrete setting aside grounds, the need for foreign law evidence, and a novel question of whether the corrections postponed the commencement of the three month period); it was factually detailed (over 500 pages of exhibits to the Applicants' affidavits, and many more materials necessitated in the Respondent's opposition to the application); the complexity was compounded by the Applicants' unreasonable conduct of the application in a number of respects; the Respondent had to expend substantial time, with a team of four counsel, to meet the complex and detailed application with its own extensive materials, its actual time and time costs being over 140 hours and $86,492.50 in total; and finally, an uplift giving the amount of $65,000 is proportionate to the award debt at stake, which is almost $14m. There is added reference to two cases in which pre-transfer costs exceeding the range in the Costs Guidelines had been awarded, namely CJM and others v CJT [2021] 5 SLR 222 (\" CJM \") and Lao Holdings NV v Government of the Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic and another matter [2023] 4 SLR 77 (\" Lao Holdings \").\n9 The Applicants' reply submissions do not canvass these submissions. Their contention is that $65,000 is inconsistent with the level of pre-transfer costs that had been awarded in comparable cases, referring to three cases: CNA v CNBand another and other matters [2023] 5 SLR 264 (\" CNA \"), CJM and Lao Holdings. The Applicants take from CNA and CJM that the pre-transfer costs awarded were within the range of 18% to 25% of the actual pre-transfer costs incurred, giving a range for this case of $15,568.65 to $21,623.13. They submit that under the Costs Guidelines, the maximum pre-transfer costs would be $16,288, a sum arrived at by taking the proportion of the actual pre-transfer costs of $86,492.50 to the actual post-transfer costs of $125,940, being 40.72%, and applying it to the $86,492.50. This, they argue, is within the range for this case derived above, and accordingly should be adopted as the amount which accords with the Costs Guidelines; or, as a fallback, if an uplift were to be applied \"to account for the complexities and unique circumstances of OA 10\", the uplift should not take the amount beyond the top of the range of $21,623.13.\n10 A difficulty with the Respondent's submissions is: an uplift from what? The Costs Guidelines' range of $13,000 to $40,000 is a daily tariff for the complete proceedings, and there must be adjustment because the pre-transfer costs are for only part of the proceedings. As was done in, for example, CNA at [26]-[30] and Lao Holdings at [97]-[98], a suitable basis is the ratio between pre-transfer costs and post-transfer costs, namely 40.72% as submitted by the Applicants, giving a starting range of $5,293.60 to $16,288. An uplift to $65,000 is a considerable departure from the guidance of the Costs Guidelines, which the Respondent's submissions mask. Nor is an uplift to that extent supported by regard to CJM or Lao Holdings. In CJM , the starting point was $12,000, with the actual pre-transfer costs of $92,500 being broadly comparable to this case, and the uplift was to $25,000. In Lao Holdings, which was a bigger and more complex case than this case, the pre-transfer costs of $42,000 were fixed at just over half the upper end of the Costs Guidelines' amount for the whole proceedings: the equivalent in this case would be in the order of $17,000. It is not easy to find guidance in other cases, as the circumstances vary greatly and true comparability is evasive: any merit in the Respondent's submissions comes rather from the reasons put forward for an uplift, but from a figure within the starting range above-mentioned.\n11 The Applicants' submissions have a different difficulty. Their core is the range of 18% to 25% of actual pre-transfer costs derived from the two cases. But only two cases, in which the percentage of the actual pre-transfer costs must depend on the particular circumstances, including the amount of the actual pre-transfer costs (for example, in CNA , they were $266,127, and an uplift would be constrained by their magnitude), scarcely warrant an across-the-board percentage in other cases. It is necessary to look to the circumstances of this case in considering occasion to depart from the Costs Guidelines, but the Applicants' submissions do not do so or respond to the reasons put forward by the Respondent.\n12 The pre-transfer work is described by the Respondent as including reviewing the Applicants' affidavits and expert report; reviewing the underlying arbitration material on which the Applicants relied, the service history of the Notices of Arbitration, the awards, and the corrections; sourcing and instructing a suitable expert on the Hong Kong law issues; preparing the Respondent's responsive affidavits; and attendance at two Registrar's case conferences. The description, which is not challenged by the Applicants, appears sound, and I accept it with the qualification that the Respondent's responsive affidavits of its CEO and Mr Tisdall were filed a month after the transfer of the proceedings and (as the description of the post-transfer work at [15] below shows) the preparation of the responsive affidavits would have spanned the transfer.\n13 I begin with a figure towards the upper end of the range of $5,293.60 to $16,288. That there were two awards added a little to the absence of notice ground, but the other grounds (whether four or really three) were common to both awards, and the grounds were not unusual in applications of this kind. The need for foreign law evidence was also a feature of the proceedings. But these complexities, and the novel question concerning the effect of the corrections, were more matters for the preparation for and conduct of the hearing, and a great impact on the work prior to the transfer of the proceedings is difficult to see. I accept that attention was needed for a considerable volume of materials in the Applicants' case and in the Respondent's case in reply, and that time would properly have been spent in coming to terms with the Applicants' materials and starting on the Respondent's materials prior to the transfer of the proceedings, and that this is a feature contributing to an uplift. I do not think that the matters said by the Respondent to have been unreasonable conduct of the application by the Applicant, a description which I do not accept, went beyond the exigencies commonly encountered in litigation. Having regard to all the Respondent's submissions, abandonment of the Costs Guidelines is not warranted, but a moderate uplift is. The amount for the pre-transfer costs should be $22,000 (as it happens, but not as a standard, about 25% of the actual pre-transfer costs).\nPost-transfer costs\n14 There is also substantial agreement on the basis for assessment of the post-transfer costs. It is a subjective approach. The starting point is the costs in fact incurred by the successful party, followed by an inquiry into whether those actual costs are proportionate and reasonable (the touchstone in O 22 r 3(1) of the SICC Rules): the policy of enhancing access to justice underlying the use of the Costs Guidelines is less relevant, and in the SICC \"the principal underlying consideration is a commercial one of ensuring that a successful litigant is not unfairly put out of pocket for sensibly prosecuting his claim or defence\" (Senda at [51]). Once the successful party has provided appropriate evidence of its incurred costs, and information in support of the claimed costs being reasonable, the unsuccessful party has the evidential burden of showing that the claimed costs are not reasonable (Senda at [75]).\n15 The post-transfer work is described by the Respondent as preparing the Respondent's responsive affidavit; preparation for and attendance at a Case Management Conference (including various Case Management Bundle filings); preparing the Respondent's written submissions; reviewing the Applicants' written submissions; and preparation for and attendance at the hearing. With the reciprocal qualification concerning the preparation of the Respondent's affidavits, again, this appears a sound description. The actual post-transfer costs incurred were $125,940. Hours and rates were provided.\n16 The Respondent effectively repeats its earlier submissions in support of the costs being reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount, with some emphasis on the research needed on the question of the effect of the corrections. I should say that I accept that a deal of time would have been involved in this, and appropriately so - I found the submissions helpful. Again, the Applicants' reply submissions do not canvass these matters. It is said that the assessment should not be limited exclusively to the facts and circumstances of this case, but that reference should be made to comparable cases for the guidance on an appropriate award of post-transfer costs. It is then said that \"because an argument can be made that [CJM] bears the closest resemblance to OA 10, both in its features and in its complexity\", the post-transfer costs should be assessed at the same amount as in that case, namely $45,000.\n17 There is really no challenge to whether the actual post-transfer costs were proportionate and reasonable: the Applicants do not attempt to satisfy the evidential burden of showing that they are not. While it can be relevant, looking to the post-transfer costs awarded in a different case, and no more, is at odds with the subjective approach to the assessment of costs under the SICC regime. Looking to the post-transfer costs awarded in CJM is of little moment when the actual post-transfer costs were $97,800 but the defendant sought only $45,000; that was awarded, with the court describing it (at [15]) as \"wholly reasonable\". I see no reason to reject the Respondent's claim of $115,000, reduced from the actual costs of $125,940, as disproportionate and unreasonable post-transfer costs.\nConclusion\n18 The Respondent's costs are therefore $144,000 in total for costs, and $7,709.38 and HKD151,978.26 for disbursements.",

        "text": "In the Singapore International Commercial Court of the Republic of Singapore\n[2024] SGHC(I) 6\nOriginating Application No 3 of 2023\nBetween\nRenault SAS\n... Claimant\nAnd\nLiberty Engineering Group Pte Ltd\n... Defendant\nOriginating Application No 9 of 2023\nBetween\nRenault SAS\n... Claimant\nAnd\nLiberty Engineering Group Pte Ltd\n... Defendant\nJudgment\n[Civil Procedure - Pleadings]\n[Contract - Contractual terms]\n[Credit and Security - Guarantees and indemnities]\n1 In earlier proceedings, commenced in the High Court and becoming SIC/S 1/2022 (\"Suit 1\") in the Singapore International Commercial Court (\"the SICC\"), the claimant claimed \u20ac7 million and statutory interest from the defendant under a Deed of Guarantee dated 5 January 2018 (\"the Guarantee\"). The proceedings were dismissed: Renault SAS v Liberty Engineering Group Pte Ltd [2023] 4 SLR 152 (\"the Suit 1 Judgment\").\n2 This judgment is given in two further proceedings, commenced in the SICC, in which the claimant again claims under the Guarantee. SIC/OA 3/2023 (\"OA 3\") was commenced before the decision in Suit 1, and SIC/OA 9/2023 (\"OA 9\") was commenced after that decision. In each proceeding the claimant claims from the defendant \u20ac5,250,025.61 (the one amount, not twice over), the balance of the previous \u20ac7 million after a part payment, plus interest.\n3 As will be explained, the three proceedings are because the claimant has sought to rely on successive events as grounds for its claim under the Guarantee, each of the later events occurring after the commencement of the previous proceedings. And the proceedings have evolved. In particular, the present proceedings have come to include as the central question whether the putative principal debtor has any liability to the claimant, and in that connection to raise a pleading issue.\n4 OA 3 and OA 9 have been heard together, with the evidence in one the evidence in the other. For the reasons which follow, the claim in OA 9 should succeed, while OA 3 should be dismissed.\nFinancial support in the purchase of a business\n5 AR Industries, a French-incorporated company, was a manufacturer of wheels for the automobile industry. On 16 January 2018 it was placed under redressment judiciare , a form of receivership or judicial restructuring, by the Commercial Court of Orleans. Administrators were appointed. The Court authorised the continuation of the business of AR Industries for a period, and the administrators advertised the business for sale.\n6 The claimant, Renault SAS (\"Renault\"), a French incorporated company and well-known automobile manufacturer, was the main customer of AR Industries. The defendant, Liberty Engineering Group Pte Ltd (\"LEG\"), a Singapore-incorporated company within the Liberty Group, was willing to acquire the operations and assets of AR Industries, but with financial support from Renault, and the two companies engaged in negotiations to that end. In early May 2018 LEG submitted a \"takeover offer\" to the administrators in the form of what was referred to as a \"sale plan\", by which it or a subsidiary to be incorporated by it purchased the business of AR Industries, the sale plan including that financial support would be provided by Renault. The negotiations then arrived at a Financial Services Agreement dated 28 May 2018 made between Renault and LEG (\"the FSA\") by which, amongst other things, Renault agreed to provide financial support to the purchaser of the business. On 29 May 2018 the Court adopted the sale plan and made orders to give effect to it.\n7 The sale plan as submitted or approved was not in evidence, but two of its features relevant for present purposes can be seen in the Court's reasons and orders.\n8 The first feature is the FSA. I will come to its terms more fully, but in relation to the provision of financial support it recorded an agreement between Renault and LEG that Renault would provide financial support to LEG or to an entity of LEG's group controlled by LEG, whichever purchased the business. The FSA was noted by the Court in three places. It recorded that LEG had entered into an agreement on 25 May 2018 (sic: I think an error for 28 May 2018) \"providing for ... the provision of financing\". It recorded as \"comments\" by Renault, represented at a hearing at which the takeover offer was considered, that \"RENAULT-NISSAN state that, after lengthy negotiations, an agreement was signed with LIBERTY ENGINEERING on 28 May 2018 at the end of the day, allowing it to support its takeover project\". And the orders included that the Court \"[a]cknowledges the memorandum of understanding dated 28 May 2018 between LIBERTY ENGINEERING and RENAULT-NISSAN concerning the following issues production volume commitments and financing arrangements [sic]\".\n9 The other feature is that, as indicated above, the purchase of the business was to be by LEG or a yet-to-be incorporated subsidiary of LEG; more accurately, that LEG could be \"substituted\" as purchaser by its subsidiary. The Court's reasons recorded this, and its orders made provision for it. The reasons included that \"[t]he offer is presented by the Singaporean company LIBERTY ENGINEERING with a full substitution clause for the benefit of a subsidiary to be established, SAS LIBERTY WHEELS France...\", and the orders included, after the adoption of the sale plan:\nOrders the transfer of the assets of the Company AR INDUSTRIES SAS ... for the benefit of the company under Singaporean law LIBERTY ENGINEERING ... with the option of substitution according to the terms provided for in the offer, the additional offer and the information provided at the hearing...\nAuthorises the full replacement, in accordance with Article L.642-9 of the French Commercial Code and the terms and conditions set out in the offer, of LIBERTY ENGINEERING by LIBERTY WHEELS FRANCE, which is in the process of being incorporated,\nLIBERTY ENGINEERING shall remain jointly and severally liable for the performance of the commitments it has entered into ...\nThe Financial Services Agreement\n10 The FSA was in English. It said in its opening that it:\n... acts the terms and conditions agreed between Liberty Group and Renault within the frame of the sale of the activity and assets (the \" Sale Plan\") of AR Industries (under \"redressment judiciare\") to Liberty Engineering [ie LEG] or to any entity of Liberty Engineering's Group (\"Newco\") which might be substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan (the \" Purchaser \").\n[bold italics in original]\n11 The parties to the FSA were expressed in Article 1 to be Renault, said to be thereafter referred to as \"Renault\" or \"the Car Manufacturer\"; LEG, said to be thereafter referred to as \"Liberty Engineering\" or \"the Guarantor 2\"; and Liberty House Group Pte Ltd (\"LHG\"), described elsewhere in the agreement as \"the mother Company of the Liberty Engineering Group\" and said to be thereafter referred to as \"Liberty House\" or \"the Guarantor 1\". However, the Article added, \"The Car Manufacturer, the Purchaser and the Guarantors 1 and 2 being hereafter referred to, collectively, as ' the Parties ' and individually as ' a Party '. [bold italics in original]\n12 Article 3 of the FSA described its purpose as being to specify \"the respective and reciprocal commitments of the Parties within the frame of the acquisition, by the Purchaser, of the operations and assets of AR Industries\". In Article 4 it was provided that:\nThe terms and conditions of the Agreement have been agreed in consideration of an acquisition of the operation and assets by the Purchaser, which will carry out the activity within its Group.\nThe Purchaser shall be Liberty Engineering or any entity of Liberty Engineering's Group controlled by Liberty Engineering.\n13 Article 5 dealt with the provision of funds by Renault and the repayment of the funds. It began:\nUpon special request of the Purchaser and of AR Industries' Receivers (Administrateurs Judiciaires) to which the present Agreement has been communicated, the Car Manufacturer commits to support the acquisition of the activities and assets of AR Industries by the Purchaser through a financial support of 7,000,000 \u20ac granted to the Purchaser according to the following payment schedule (the \" Financial Support \") ...\n[bold italics in original]\n14 In summary as to the provision of funds, Renault agreed to provide the financial support by payments of \u20ac1,500,000 on 1 July and 30 October 2018, \u20ac2,500,000 on 1 July 2019, and \u20ac1,500,000 on 1 July 2020. All payments were subject to the Purchaser complying with its commitments under the FSA, and the 2019 and 2020 payments were subject to provision of a guarantee by Aluminium Dunkerque, a company which the Liberty Group was in the process of acquiring, or agreement on an \"alternative first demand guarantee of equivalent efficiency\".\n15 As to repayment of the funds, the Article provided:\nThe Financial Support offered by Renault will be totally reimbursed by the Purchaser to Renault over 4 years, as of 2022 (year 1) to 2025 (year 4), through a cash payment of 1.750.000 \u20ac per year made by the Purchaser to Renault on June 1st of each year (i.e. for the first time on June 1st, 2022), except if the Purchaser fails to comply with any of the repayment terms, in which case the amount of the Financial Support already paid will become immediately refundable by the Purchaser and the Guarantors 1, 2 and 3.\n16 It will be recalled that LHG was entitled Guarantor 1 and LEG was entitled Guarantor 2. From Article 10 next referred to dealing with the provision of guarantees, Aluminium Dunkerque was Guarantor 3.\n17 Article 10 of the FSA was lengthy. It began:\nIn case of the opening of bankruptcy proceedings towards the Purchaser (sauvegarde, redressment judiciare or liquidation judiciare) and/or if the Purchaser fails to reimburse the Financial Support in due time (as referred to in Article 5) for any reason whatsoever, Liberty House Group, as Guarantor 1, commits to reimburse to Renault the Financial Support paid to the Purchaser, on first demand, in place of the Purchaser, within the same schedule. For the sake of clarity, it is specified that in case the amount of the Financial Support already paid becomes immediately refundable by the Purchaser, it will also become immediately refundable by the Guarantor 1.\nMoreover, in case i) the Purchaser is an entity of Liberty Engineering's Group substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan, and ii) a bankruptcy proceedings is opened towards the Purchaser (sauvegarde, redressment judiciare or liquidation judiciare) and/or iii) the Purchaser fails to reimburse the Financial Support in due time (as referred to in Article 5) for any reason whatsoever, Liberty Engineering, as Guarantor 2, commits to reimburse to Renault the Financial Support paid to the Purchaser, on first demand, in place of the Purchaser, within the same schedule. For the sake of clarity, it is specified that in case the amount of the Financial Support already paid becomes immediately refundable by the Purchaser, it will also become immediately refundable by the Guarantor 2.\nTo this end, Liberty House Group and Liberty Engineering, each as far as it is concerned, commit to provide Renault, within 10 business days, following the signing of the Agreement, with (i) a first demand guarantee duly approved by their competent corporate bodies, and (ii) a legal opinion from a Singapore leading law firm, attesting that these two guarantees were regularly issued in particular as regards their corporate interest and that they will be efficiently enforceable (together, the \" First Demand Guarantees 1 and 2 \").\n[bold italics in original]\n18 The Article went on to deal with the provision by Aluminium Dunkerque, as Guarantor 3, of a First Demand Guarantee 3 in like terms to the First Demand Guarantees 1 and 2, following its acquisition by LHG. It included a guarantee by LEG and LHG that Aluminium Dunkerque would give the guarantee.\n19 The Article concluded:\nRenault will be allowed to call the First Demand Guarantees 1 and 2 simultaneously or one after the other, in any order, at Renault's option, until full repayment of the Financial Support paid to the Purchaser. The First Demand Guarantee 3 will be enforceable by Renault if the Purchaser and/or the Guarantors 1 and 2 failed to perform their obligations within 10 business days after Renault's demand.\nAs an exception to the above, the First Demand Guarantees 1, 2 and 3 will be enforceable simultaneously, in any order, at Renault's option, until full repayment of the Financial Support paid to the Purchaser, in case the amount of the Financial Support already paid becomes immediately refundable by the Purchaser and the Guarantors.\n20 Other Articles, the detail of which does not matter, included forecasts for volumes of wheels to be ordered by Renault over 2019, 2020 and 2021, and prices for the wheels, with many qualifications as to both, including that the volume forecasts \"do not entail any firm commitment from Renault in terms of effective volumes to be ordered to the Purchaser nor in terms of effective turnover to be achieved with the Purchaser\" (in Article 6) and that without prejudice to the commitment to discuss in good faith neither the Purchaser nor any entity of its Group, or their managers and/or shareholders, would have any \"recourse/claim of any kind against Renault ... as regards ... the level of volumes ordered by Renault from 2018 onwards ...\" (in Article 14). Article 6 included, however, a commitment by the Parties to negotiate in good faith towards compensation if the level of the volume forecasts was not achieved.\n21 Article 13 stated a number of commitments of the Purchaser \"[a]s a counterpart of Renault's commitments\". Some were administrative (for example, to provide annual accounts) or aspirational (for example, to make best efforts to become fully competitive within three years, and to develop a relationship of trust with Renault). Others had potential significance, such as to maintain a level of performance in terms inter alia of quality, logistics, process, costs, engineering and lead times in order to meet Renault's purchasing terms and conditions, and \"to ensure deliveries to [Renault] in accordance with the volumes ordered, and delivery lead times\".\n22 The FSA was expressed to be \"governed by French law\".\n23 As is apparent from the opening and Article 3, the Purchaser was not a certain entity but could be either LEG, the takeover offeror under the sale plan, or if there were a substitution under the sale plan an entity controlled by it. In this respect the FSA reflected the substitution clause in the sale plan, although (as later discussed) not by some equivalent form of substitution clause but by defining the Purchaser as LEG or, if there were a substitution, the entity controlled by it. The potential subsidiary did not yet exist, and of course was not a signatory to the FSA: the signatories were Renault, LEG and LHG. But Article 1 included that the Purchaser was within the description of a Party or the Parties, and the FSA included many commitments (the term generally used) of the Purchaser (Article 5 as to repayment and Article 13 being some, but there were more) and commitments of the Parties: so that, if the Purchaser turned out to be the entity controlled by LEG, as it did, the FSA purported to impose obligations on a non-existent non-signatory to the FSA. This was at the root of the question of the putative principal debtor's liability.\nLiberty Wheels is the Purchaser\n24 LibertyWheels France (\"Liberty Wheels\") was created on 1 June 2018, and on 11 June 2018 was registered in the Trade and Companies Register of France and therefore incorporated. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of LEG.\n25 The substitution authorised by the Commercial Court of Orleans took place, and the purchaser of the business became Liberty Wheels in place of LEG (although in accordance with the Court's order, it seems that LEG would have remained as joint and several obligor for the commitments it had entered into under the sale plan). The evidence did not reveal what formality, if any, gave effect to or recorded the substitution, but as it later appears, it must have taken place prior to the execution of the Guarantee.\n26 Consequently, the Purchaser under the FSA was Liberty Wheels, purportedly liable to repay the financial support to be provided by Renault and to fulfil the other commitments of the Purchaser under the FSA.\nThe Guarantee\n27 The Guarantee was dated 5 July 2018. It was common ground that it was given by LEG as First Demand Guarantee 2 pursuant to the agreement to do so in Article 10 of the FSA.\n28 The parties to the Guarantee were LEG, entitled and defined as Guarantor, and Renault, entitled and defined as Financial Support Provider. Their identification was followed by a \"Summary\", clearly distinct from the subsequent operative provisions, which included that the \"Guaranteed obligations\" were:\nAll liabilities of the Purchaser relating to the Financial Support stated in the agreement signed by Renault SAS, Liberty Engineering Group Pte. Ltd as Guarantor 2 and Liberty House Group Pte. Ltd as Guarantor 1 on 28 May 2018 within the frame of the sale of the activity and assets of AR Industries (under redressment judiciare) to Liberty Engineering or to any entity of Liberty Engineering's Group which might be substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan.\n29 The definitions included that Purchaser meant Liberty Wheels: hence the substitution must have taken place. Other definitions were:\nBankruptcy Event means the taking of any corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure or step in relation to the opening of any bankruptcy proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde financiere acceleree, sauvegarde acceleree, redressment judiciare or liquidation judiciare) towards the Purchaser.\nFinancial Support Document means the agreement signed by Renault SAS, Liberty Engineering Group Pte. Ltd. as Guarantor 2 and Liberty House Group Pte. Ltd. as Guarantor 1 on 28 May 2018, within the scope of the sale of the activity and assets of AR Industries (under \"redressment judiciare\") to Liberty Engineering or to any entity of Liberty Engineering's Group which might be substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan (as defined in the Financial Support Document)\"\nObligations means all money and liabilities (including debts) owing or incurred to the Financial Support Provider by the Purchaser under or in relation with [sic] the provisions of the Financial Support Document relating to the Financial Support (as such term is defined in the Financial Support Document), and in any capacity irrespective of whether such moneys or liabilities: (i) are present or future, (ii) are actual, contingent or otherwise, (iii) are at any time ascertained or unascertained, (iv) are owed, incurred by or on account of the Purchaser alone, or severally or jointly with any other person, (v) are owed or incurred as principal, interests, fees, charges, taxes, duties or other imposts, damages (whether for breach of contract or tort or incurred on any other ground), losses, costs or expenses, or on any other account, or (vi) comprise any combination of the above.\n30 As the key operative clause, the Guarantee provided in cll 2.1 and 2.2, under the heading \"Guarantee and Indemnity\", in the terms:\n2.1 Subject to clause 2.2, the Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally:\n(a) guarantees to the Financial Support Provider the due and punctual performance, observance and discharge by the Purchaser of any and all the Obligations;\n(b) undertakes that (i) whenever the Purchaser does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with the Financial Support Document or (ii) upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event, the Guarantor shall immediately on demand by the Financial Support Provider pay that amount to the Financial Support Provider as if it was the Purchaser; and\n(c) agrees that the Guarantor shall, as principal obligor and as a separate, primary and independent obligation, indemnify and keep indemnified the Financial Support Provider in full and immediately on demand against any cost, loss, liability, damages, claims, demands and expenses suffered or incurred by the Financial Support Provider as a result of any of the Obligations being or becoming void, voidable, unenforceable, invalid, illegal or ineffective against the Financial Support Provider for any reason whatsoever, whether or not known by the Financial Support Provider. The amount payable by the Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this clause 2 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.\n2.2 Although this guarantee shall be construed and take effect as a guarantee of the whole and every part of the Obligations, the total amount recoverable under this guarantee shall be limited to \u20ac7,000,000.\n31 The Guarantee continued for a number of pages with many more clauses, most of the kind commonly found in such a document essentially protective of the beneficiary of a guarantee such as waiver of defences and not proving in competition with the beneficiary. The collection of clauses was generous, and included (cl 7.1):\nThe Rights created by this Deed are in addition to any other Rights of the Financial Support Provider against the Guarantor under any other documentation, the general law or otherwise. They will not merge with or limit those other Rights, and are not limited by them.\n32 The Guarantee was expressed to be governed by and construed in accordance with Singapore law.\n33 The FSA called for a legal opinion that First Demand Guarantees 1 and 2 were regularly issued and \"efficiently enforceable\" (see [17] above). A legal opinion dated 5 July 2018 was provided. In describing the \"Background\" to the opinion, it was said that it was given in relation to the Singapore law aspects of a \"Transaction\" by which Renault \"has made available financial support by way of short-term loans of up to \u20ac7,000,000 to Liberty Wheels France (the Purchaser)\" [bold in original] and that \"certain affiliate companies of the Purchaser... have entered into guarantees for the purpose of securing repayment of that financial support\"; although, strangely, the FSA was not amongst the documents which it was said the lawyers had examined relating to the Transaction. The opinion was hedged around with many qualifications, and perhaps less than direct when it said that neither of the guarantees was \"void, voidable, unenforceable, ineffective, or otherwise capable of being affected as a result of any vitiating matter (such as mistake, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, fraud, or breach of directors' duties) that is not clear from the terms of the Guarantees\".\nFunds are advanced to Liberty Wheels\n34 The first two payments totalling \u20ac3 million were made by payment to Liberty Wheels of \u20ac1.5m on 13 July 2018 and \u20ac1.5m on 30 October 2018. There was no evidence of any communications in relation to the payments.\n35 The third payment of \u20ac2.5 million was made on 31 May 2019. Apparently after an informal communication, on 15 May 2019 Mr Pot of Renault asked Mr Douziech of Liberty Wheels to \"please send me an e-mail today formalising your request for payment in cash on 1 June in accordance with the memorandum of understanding\", saying that it would be \"used as justification in our payment workflow\". Mr Douziech responded with an email:\nLiberty Wheels France hereby requests Renault to pay customer support amounting to \u20ac2.5 million in accordance with the protocol signed between the 2 parties at the time of the takeover of AR Industries. We remind you that this amount is due no later than 1 June. For ease of reference, the bank details for our account are attached.\n36 The fourth payment of \u20ac1.5 million was made on 17 June 2020. On 18 May 2020 Mr Avelli of Liberty Wheels emailed Mr Caiazzo of Renault:\nUnder the bilateral agreement between Renault and Liberty Wheels France, the final instalment of the \u20ac1.5 million financial support is due to be paid on 1 June 2020.\nI would be grateful if you could assure us that this sum will be paid on time. A bank details form is attached for your convenience.\n37 There was no further evidence of communications concerning payment of the financial support.\nLiberty Wheels (now Alvance) goes into liquidation\n38 At some point Liberty Wheels became Alvance Aluminium Wheels (\"Alvance\"). For convenience, from here on in these reasons I will refer to it as Alvance even in relation to events prior to the change of name, unless the context or a quotation requires otherwise.\n39 In circumstances unexplained in the evidence, on 23 April 2021, Alvance was placed under redressment judiciare by the Paris Commercial Court.\n40 On 6 July 2021, Renault filed a proof of claim with Alvance's court-appointed creditors' representatives. It provided, amongst other documents, a copy of the FSA and proof of the payments to Alvance and claimed \u20ac7 million as a \"Debt resulting from the Financing Agreement\" with the description, \"Under Article 5 of the Financing Agreement, a prior claim to fall due for a total amount of seven million Euros (\u20ac7,000,000) corresponding to the Advance\". [bold in original]\n41 On 1 February 2022 the Paris Commercial Court approved a plan to sell the operations and assets of Alvance to a third party. On 2 February 2022, by a judgment of the Court the redressment judiciare was converted into liquidation judiciare , whereby Alvance went into liquidation.\n42 By a \"Notification of Admitted Claims\" dated 28 March 2022, the proof of claim filed by Renault on 6 July 2021 for \u20ac7 million was \"approved\" and entered on the list of claims concerning Alvance.\nThe evolving proceedings\n43 I will come to the issues at the hearing, but it is appropriate to see how they came about.\nSuit 1\n44 The first repayment of \u20ac1,750,000 was due on 1 June 2022. Well before that date, on 20 May 2021, Renault issued a letter of demand for payment by LEG of the sum of \u20ac7 million on the basis that the opening of the redressment judiciare proceedings for the benefit of Alvance was a Bankruptcy Event as described in the Guarantee and the full sum was payable to it pursuant to cl 2.1 of the Guarantee.\n45 Renault commenced Suit 1 in the High Court on 31 May 2021, claiming the \u20ac7 million on that basis. Prior to the hearing, on the due date of 1 June 2022, it received payment of \u20ac1,749,974.39 from Liberty Financial Management (LIG) Ltd (\"LFG\"), a related company of LEG: the minor discrepancy in amount has been ignored in all proceedings, and this has been treated as full payment of the first repayment. Thus when Suit 1 was heard, as well as when it was commenced, there had not been a failure in repayment on the due date so as to trigger repayment of the full amount of the financial support.\n46 In Suit 1, Renault relied on cl 2.1(b) of the Guarantee. It did not say that the Bankruptcy Event made the full amount of the financial support immediately repayable by the Purchaser - it was common ground that under Article 5 of the FSA, that was the result only of failure by the Purchaser to comply with the repayment terms, that is, to make one of the 1 June payments. It said that under cl 2.1(b) of the Guarantee, upon the Bankruptcy Event, LEG had a primary liability, independent of any liability of the Purchaser, to pay the full amount of the financial support.\n47 LEG admitted the Bankruptcy Event. But it said that as a matter of construction of the Guarantee it (LEG) was only liable to pay Renault if the Purchaser failed to adhere to the payment terms in Article 5 of the FSA; since the Bankruptcy Event had not accelerated repayment by the Purchaser, the Purchaser had not so failed. As of 31 May 2021, it said, nothing was payable by Alvance to Renault, so nothing was payable by LEG to Renault.\n48 After transfer to the SICC, Suit 1 was heard on 25 April 2023, and judgment was given on 19 May 2023. In short, it was held that in cl 2.1(b) of the Guarantee LEG's promise to pay if there was a Bankruptcy Event was to pay \"that amount\"; that this referred back to \"any amount when due under or in connection with the Financial Support Document\", that is, an amount due under or in connection with the FSA which the Purchaser had not paid; and so \"that amount\" had to be an amount which had become payable by the Purchaser. The full amount of the financial support had not become payable by the Purchaser, so it was not payable by LEG. The proceedings were dismissed.\nRenault brings OA 3\n49 Having first issued a further letter of demand for payment by LEG, Renault commenced OA 3 in the SICC on 30 March 2023. In the Statement of Case, it claimed \u20ac5,250,025.61, being the full amount of the financial support less the payment received on 1 June 2022. It pleaded the provision of the financial support pursuant to the terms of the FSA, specifically cll 5 and 10 of the FSA, and the redressment judiciare proceedings as a Bankruptcy Event making the \u20ac7 million immediately payable pursuant to cl 2.1 of the Guarantee. It was then alleged that the conversion of the redressment judiciare proceedings into liquidation judiciare on 2 February 2022, a liquidation without any continuation of business by Alvance, by French law rendered all unmatured debts of Alvance due and payable; therefore, the \u20ac7 million had in February 2022 become due and payable by the Purchaser to Renault \"under the Financial Support Agreement\" and was unpaid \"under the Financial Support Agreement\".\n50 The pleading is puzzling. The essence was the making of unmatured debts immediately payable. The Bankruptcy Event may have made the guarantor liable (although in Suit 1 it was held that it did not), but that would have been LEG's debt, not the Purchaser's. The reference to the Bankruptcy Event appears to have been surplusage, and it was meant that the debt of Alvance as the Purchaser, under cl 5 of the FSA payable on 1 June of future years, was made immediately payable: LEG did not appear to take it otherwise. I have quoted the terms of the pleading, namely \"under the Financial Support Agreement\"; as will shortly be explained, that it was alleged that the money was payable and unpaid by the Purchaser \"under the Financial Support Agreement\" had some significance.\n51 It is perhaps odd that OA 3 was brought on the new basis when the claim in Suit 1 was yet to be heard. By agreement, the progress of OA 3 was paused to await the result in Suit 1.\nA question of Alvance's liability is raised\n52 The Suit 1 Judgment issued on 19 May 2023 included:\n51. The Purchaser in this case was not LEG, but Alvance, an entity controlled by LEG and not a signatory to the FSA. As mentioned above ... whether by French law Alvance would be bound under the FSA to make repayment according to its terms was raised in the course of the hearing. Mr Leo [leading counsel for Renault] was inclined to submit that it was not, in aid of LEG's liability being a primary liability because there was no liability of Alvance to which it could be secondary. Mr Chew [leading counsel for LEG] submitted that it was, referring to the Purchaser's description and treatment as a Party in the FSA.\n52. It was evident that the question came to counsel unanticipated, neither spoke with the benefit of French law, and the question did not receive real consideration. It could arise in SIC/OA 3/2023, and unless it is necessary to answer it, it should be left unanswered in these proceedings. ... I do not think it matters, in the present task of construction, whether in cl 2.1(b) the Purchaser's failure to pay any amount when due is failure in an obligation to pay or simply failure in the fact of timely payment, or more generally whether there can ever be an amount payable by it as the Purchaser. Even assuming in Renault's favour that Alvance was not bound under the FSA to make repayment according to its terms, labelling LEG's liability as a primary liability for that reason does not advanced Renault's position.\n53 If LEG took up the point - which it in due course did - the question had significance for OA 3, and for the future OA 9. As previously noted, in OA 3 it was asserted that the \u20ac7 million was payable and unpaid under the FSA. The definition of Obligations, picked up in cl 2.1(a) of the Guarantee, referred to money or liabilities \"owing or incurred to [Renault] by [Liberty Wheels] under or in relation with the provisions of the Financial Support Agreement\", and cl 2.1(b) similarly referred to an \"amount when due under or in connection with the Financial Support Document\" [emphasis added]. If Alvance was not bound by the provisions of the FSA (and although it had not been in evidence in Suit 1, it is now known that Alvance did not even exist when the FSA was entered into), it seemed that it could not have a liability under the provisions of the FSA: in the event, in the proceedings that was the accepted position, with whether Alvance was bound by the provisions of the FSA being framed as whether it was a party to the FSA. So there was exposed whether Alvance might be liable to repay the financial support otherwise than under the FSA, but on a basis which was in relation with the provisions of the FSA or in connection with the FSA.\n54 The question of Alvance's liability to Renault under the FSA, apparently triggered by the aside in the Suit 1 Judgment, came to loom large in OA 3 and OA 9. In those proceedings the parties took opposite positions to those tentatively taken in Suit 1. Renault's submissions included that Alvance was a party to the FSA and liable as Purchaser under it; LEG contended that it was not. But Renault also submitted that Alvance was liable to repay the financial support under a separate contract with Renault either on the same terms as the FSA, and from this came the pleading issue: whether Renault had sufficiently pleaded a separate contract bringing liability in relation with the provisions of the FSA or in connection with the FSA.\nRenault amends OA 3\n55 It appeared that Renault was alive to the significance of the point. At a Case Management Conference held on 28 June 2023 to progress OA 3, Renault's counsel proposed to amend OA 3 \"to accord with the findings that have been made in the earlier proceedings concerning, for example, the parties to the Financial Support Agreement, and to restate our claim based on how obligations are defined in the Guarantee\".\n56 The relevant amendment, made on 12 July 2023, was that the \u20ac7 million had in February 2022 become due and payable by the Purchaser to Renault \"under or in relation with\" the FSA and was unpaid by it \"under or in relation with\" the FSA, and that the Guarantee caught the Purchaser's liabilities to Renault \"under or in relation with\" the FSA. But the pleading still left the FSA as the source of the unmatured debt which was said to become immediately repayable upon the liquidationjudiciare and did not identify any other source of an obligation to pay \"in relation with\" the FSA (except, perhaps, that the French law which made unmatured debts immediately repayable was something \"in relation with\" the FSA). The amendments were inadequate, and in the event, it was not submitted on behalf of Renault that they sufficed for a liability to repay the financial support on a basis which was not under the provisions of the FSA but in relation with the provisions of the FSA.\nRenault brings OA 9\n57 The payment of \u20ac1,750,000 due on 1 June 2023 was not made. Alvance was in liquidation. LEG did not step in, through LFG or otherwise, as it apparently had in the case of the payment due on 1 June 2022, perhaps emboldened by the question of Alvance's liability to Renault under the FSA.\n58 After another letter of demand for payment by Renault, on 12 July 2023, LEG commenced OA 9 in the SICC, again claiming \u20ac5,250,025.61 and now on the basis that the failure in payment on 1 June 2023 had made the whole of the balance of the financial support immediately repayable and caught by cl 2.1 of the Guarantee. It was pleaded that the Purchaser was obliged to make the 1 June payment \"pursuant to Clause 5 of the Financial Support Agreement\" but (in partial conformity with the amendments in OA 3) that it had failed to pay the \u20ac5,250,025.61 \"under or in relation with the Financial Support Agreement\". This again left the FSA as the source of the obligation to pay, and again in the event it was not submitted that the passing reference to failure to pay in relation with the FSA sufficed for a case of liability to repay the \u20ac5,250,025.61 on a basis which was not under the provisions of the FSA but in relation with the provisions of the FSA.\nLEG's response\n59 In Suit 1, LEG had not contested that it was liable to pay under the Guarantee if the Purchaser failed to adhere to the payment terms in Article 5 of the FSA, and liable to pay as guarantor in accordance with those payment terms. It now took the point that Alvance had no liability to Renault under the FSA.\n60 In OA 3, in its Defence first filed, LEG did not admit that a liquidation judiciare rendered all debts immediately payable. It denied that the \u20ac7 million had become payable by the Purchaser \"under the terms of the Financial Support Agreement\", because Alvance was not a party to the FSA and under French law there could not be a binding commitment by a person not a party to the contract. In what can be seen as a summary of this position, the Defence included:\nPursuant to the matter pleaded in paragraphs 15(a) and 15(b) above, the Purchaser had no primary obligation to pay the sum of EUR 7,000,000 under the terms of the Financial Support Agreement. The Defendant avers therefore that as guarantor, it would have no obligation to pay the sum of EUR 5,250,025.61 as claimed by the Plaintiff.\n61 As Renault's submissions were at pains to point out, this was a radical departure from LEG's position in Suit 1. For example, LEG's submissions in Suit 1 had included that \"[Alvance's] obligation to make payment to Renault of the first instalment owed under the FSA had not arisen at the date it was placed under redressment judiciare \", and that LEG was \"only obliged, as a guarantor, to make payment in compliance with [Alvance's] contractual repayment schedule set out in the FSA\". However, the point having been taken, the proceedings must be decided accordingly.\n62 In an amendment to the Defence in OA 3, LEG added that under French law any acceleration of debts upon liquidation judiciare applied only to the debts of the debtor in judicial liquidation, and did not have the effect of accelerating any obligations of a guarantor.\n63 LEG's response in OA 9 was the same in relation to the obligation of the Purchaser. It was said that the Purchaser did not have any obligations to Renault under the FSA, because it was not a party to the FSA and under French law there could not be a binding contractual commitment on a person not a party to the contract. Alvance had \"no primary obligation to make payment under the terms of\" the FSA, and it had no obligation to pay the \u20ac5,250,025.61 \"under or in relation to the [FSA]\" (the \"or in relation to\" reflecting the allegation in the Statement of Case); therefore, LEG had no obligation as guarantor.\nAn expansion in Renault's Replies\n64 In its Reply in OA 3, Renault followed two lines in relation to the obligation of the Purchaser. One was that Alvance fell within the description of \"Purchaser\" in the FSA, having been substituted for LEG, and that as Purchaser it was a party to the FSA and was bound by its terms. The essence of the pleading in this respect was that by requesting and accepting payment under the FSA, Alvance had \"by conduct accepted and submitted to\" the FSA and was a party to it and bound by it. The other was that even if Alvance was not a party to the FSA, LEG was obliged to pay the \u20ac5,250,256.61 under the Guarantee because the \u20ac7 million was a liability \"owing or incurred to [Renault] by [Alvance] in relation with the provisions of the Financial Support Agreement\" or \"due under or in connection the Financial Support Agreement\" [bold in original]. I will return to the pleading in this respect in more detail later in these reasons (see [101]). In relation to the acceleration of debts only applying to the debts of the debtor in judicial liquidation, Renault accepted that the acceleration was not enforceable against a guarantor unless otherwise agreed between the parties; but, it said, from the terms of the FSA there had been such agreement by what was called a \"waiver of the benefit of a specific term\" clause.\n65 The Reply in OA 9 followed the same two lines described above, although for some reason only describing the \u20ac7 million as a liability owing or incurred to Renault by Alvance \"in relation with\" the provisions of the FSA and omitting reference to it being due \"in connection with\" the FSA. Again, I will return to the pleading in more detail later in these reasons (see [102]).\nThe hearing\n66 The proceedings were heard on 18 December 2023. As in Suit 1, the hearing was conducted on an agreed statement of facts and an agreed bundle of documents. There were questions of French law concerning the position of Alvance either as a party to the FSA or as otherwise obliged to repay the financial support, and in relation to the consequences of the liquidation judiciare. Permission had been given for questions of French law to be determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof. Mr Liu Zhao Xiang appeared as lead counsel for Renault, with the submissions on French law by Mr Laurent Assaya of the Paris Bar; Mr Chew Kei-Jin appeared as lead counsel for LEG, with the submissions on French law by Mr Gilles Podeur also of the Paris Bar.\nThe issues\n67 The issues at the hearing were:\n(a) whether Alvance was a party to the FSA, that is, liable thereunder to repay the financial support;\n(b) if not, whether Alvance was liable to repay the financial support under a separate contract on terms corresponding to those in the FSA, or on what Mr Liu described as \"a simple bare quantum meruit basis\"; with which was linked;\n(c) whether Renault had pleaded a liability to repay the financial support under a separate contract, that is, otherwise than as a party to the FSA; and\n(d) whether the acceleration of Alvance's debts in the judicial liquidation also accelerated the obligation of LEG as guarantor.\n68 Some further explanation is necessary. First, Mr Liu proposed a further issue of whether LEG \"is obliged to pay Renault the sums outstanding that are owed by Alvance to Renault under the terms of the guarantee\"; but, subject perhaps to the \"in relation with/in connection with\" question mentioned in the next paragraph, that was effectively consequential on the decision of the other issues and did not receive separate attention. Secondly, there was in addition some reference to particular recovery by Renault under cl 2.1(c) of the Guarantee, the indemnity clause: I will come to that separately (see [124]-[126]).\n69 Matters not in issue at the hearing should be noted. I do not think that LEG disputed that, if Alvance was liable to repay the financial support as a party to the FSA, it had become obliged to repay the \u20ac5,250,025.61 because the payment of \u20ac1,750,000 due on 1 June 2023 was not made (that is, on the OA 9 basis), or that in that event it was liable for that sum as guarantor. Nor when the issues were discussed at the hearing did it raise that, if Alvance was liable to repay the financial support under a separate contract with similar repayment terms to those in the FSA, its liability was not \"in relation with the provisions of\" the FSA or \"in connection with\" the FSA; its written submissions had contested this, but from this the contest appeared to have been abandoned, and nothing was said of it by Mr Chew in oral submissions. In case I am wrong in this understanding, I will in any event explain why I do not accept LEG's position as set out in the written submissions (see [128]), so that (assuming a sufficient pleading) in that case LEG would also be liable for the \u20ac5,250,025.61 as guarantor on the OA 9 basis. Finally, and conversely, and as will be seen including in relation to recovery under the indemnity clause, Mr Liu accepted that if he did not establish that Alvance was liable to repay the financial support, the claims against LEG would fail.\nIs OA 3 redundant?\n70 If it is held that Alvance is liable to repay the financial support, whether as a party to the FSA or under a separate contract, Renault will recover the \u20ac5,250,025.61 in OA9. If Renault fails in OA 9, the issue of a separate contract including the pleading point being the same in OA 3, that will be the end of OA 3 as well as OA 9: there can be no debt to accelerate. Is there any point in OA 3, and in deciding issue (d)?\n71 At a Case Management Conference in August 2023, after the commencement of OA 9, Mr Liu foreshadowed discontinuing OA 3 on the basis that \"OA 9 itself, is sufficient based on what the defendant has pleaded\". That did not happen, as I understand it from correspondence to the Court because there could not be agreement over costs attendant upon a discontinuance. OA 3 continued, without any explanation of why it should.\n72 Nonetheless, there could be a point in OA 3. The demand in that case was made on 3 February 2023. In OA 9, the demand was made on 9 June 2023. Interest was claimed in both cases. While interest is discretionary (see eg , Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Limited v the Bank of India and another [2016] 3 SLR 1308 at [138]), interest may and ordinarily will run from the date of accrual of the cause of action, and in OA 3 the interest could be a little greater.\n73 The overlap in the proceedings may arise in relation to costs, which is a matter for the future. It is appropriate to decide issue (d) and OA 3.\nIssue (a): liability of Alvance as a party to the FSA\n74 It was common ground that this issue was governed by French law. Mr Assaya submitted that Alvance was a party to the FSA on one or other of two bases: first, under the principle of consensualisme in French contract law; or secondly, by way of substitution in accordance with French law.\nConsensualisme\n75 The term takes up Article 1172 of the French Civil Code (the \"Code\"), which provides:\nContracts are consensual in principle.\nBy way of exception, the validity of solemn contracts is subject to the observance of forms determined by law, failing, which the contract is null and void, unless it is possible to regularise it.\nIn addition, the law makes the formation of certain contracts conditional on the delivery of something.\n76 However, Article 1172 is under the heading of the form of contracts, and (as Mr Assaya acknowledged) it is necessary to go to the provisions of the Code concerning the formation of contracts. Relevantly, they are:\nArticle 1113: The contract is formed by the meeting of an offer and an acceptance by which the parties demonstrate their willingness to commit themselves.\nThis intention may be the result of a statement or an unequivocal contact on the part of its author.\nArticle 1114: The offer, whether made to a specific or unspecified person, includes the essential elements of the contract envisaged and expresses the will of its author to be bound in case of acceptance. Otherwise, there is only an invitation to enter into negotiations.\nArticle 1118: Acceptance is the expression of the author's intention to be bound under the terms of the offer ...\n77 Mr Assaya submitted that under the principle of consensualisme , the will of the parties was the only element that mattered (unless there was a formal requirement, which there was not in this case); and that no particular form was required for the meeting of the will of the parties, and the acceptance of the terms of a contract could be tacit and could be inferred from the circumstances of the case including conduct. The essence of his submissions then was that in this case it should be found that by requesting and receiving payment of the funds advanced by Renault, as shown by the correspondence in May 2019 and May 2020 as money payable \"in accordance with the protocol, signed between the two parties [Liberty Wheels and Renault]...\" and \"[u]nder the bilateral agreement between Renault and Liberty Wheels France\", Alvance had by its conduct agreed to be bound by the FSA. In the written submissions, it was said that Alvance \"tacitly accepted to be a party to the FSA and to be bound by its terms\", and in oral submissions Mr Assaya described this as \"adherence\", that Alvance \"chose to adhere to be a party to the FSA\".\n78 I do not accept the submission. The submissions made by Mr Assaya for the consensualisme argument were taken up in relation to issue (b), and I discuss them more fully in that connection. But any contract found from the request for and receipt of the funds on the terms in the correspondence in May 2019 and May 2020 would be a contract separate from the FSA. I do not think that Mr Assaya explained how under French law there was thereafter adherence in the sense of it becoming a party to the FSA, as distinct from the formation of a separate contract. That was essentially Mr Podeur's point: that the FSA was an existing agreement entered into between Renault, LEG, and LHG before Alvance existed, that the question was not its validity but whether Alvance became a party to it, and that Alvance and LEG could not be parties as Purchaser at the same time.\n79 In answer to a question concerning adherence, meaning becoming a party to the FSA, Mr Assaya referred to a decision of the Court of Cassation dated 15 November 1994, First Civil Chamber, No 92-18.981. He described it as a decision that doctors who had succeeded others as members of a doctor's partnership should be considered as parties to the professional practice agreement entered into by their predecessors with other members of the partnership, because they had been performing the agreement, although they had not signed it or initially been parties to it. I do not think that is a correct description: the doctors were bound by the practice agreement, but the decision did not go further than a contract, distinct from the contract entered into by their predecessors, formed by their conduct as members of the partnership.\n80 I do not think that this case assists Mr Assaya's submission. It must be remembered that Alvance did not exist at the time the FSA was entered into, and what could happen thereafter whereby it became a party to the FSA would require a meeting of the wills of all of Renault, LEG, and LHG together with Alvance; the evidence is insufficient to come to that finding. I am not persuaded that Alvance became a party to the FSA under the principle of consensualisme.\nSubstitution\n81 In general terms, under French law it is possible for a contracting party to be replaced by a third party in the contractual relationship, whereby the third party becomes a party to the contract and can request performance of the contract for its benefit. One of the circumstances in which that can be done is illustrated by the purchase of the business of AR Industries, where the agreement approved by the Court was for the purchase of the business by LEG with the ability to substitute Alvance as the purchaser. That circumstance is particularly regulated by Article L.642-9 of the French Commercial Code:\nAny substitution of transferee must be authorised by the court in the judgment adopting the sale plan, without prejudice to the implementation of the provisions of Article L.642-6. The bidder of the bid selected by the court remains jointly and severally liable for the performance of the commitments he/she/it has undertaken.\n82 However, subject to the submission of Mr Podeur concerning assignment discussed at [87] below, the Code does not refer to substitution. The circumstances in which there may be substitution and the parameters of its operation must be found elsewhere. With respect, the submissions were not entirely helpful.\n83 In Mr Assaya's submission, the FSA contained a substitution clause for the benefit of any entity in LEG's group, being the clause in its opening which for convenience I repeat, that it:\n... acts the terms and conditions agreed between Liberty Group and Renault within the frame of the sale of the activity and assets (the \" Sale Plan\") of AR Industries (under \"redressment judiciare\") to Liberty Engineering [ie LEG] or to any entity of Liberty Engineering's Group (\"Newco\") which might be substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan (the \" Purchaser \").\n[bold italics in original]\n84 This was picked up in Article 4 of the FSA, stating that the Purchaser \"shall be Liberty Engineering or any entity of Liberty Engineering Group controlled by Liberty Engineering\". Mr Assaya submitted that unless otherwise stipulated in the contract, the enforcement of a substitution provision is not subject to any formal condition, referring to a decision of the Court of Cassation dated 21 June 2018, Third Civil Chamber, No 17-18.738; and that, the substitution option in the sale plan having been exercised by LEG, the consequential substitution contemplated and provided for in the FSA was effected by Alvance exercising the Purchaser's rights under the FSA (by which I understand him to mean requesting, and receiving, the financial assistance as earlier described).\n85 Mr Podeur's response was twofold: firstly, that since 2016 (and so at the time of the FSA) substitution had been governed by an article of the Code dealing with the contractual assignment of agreements which required that an assignment must be in writing, and that any substitution/assignment was ineffective for lack of writing; but secondly and more fundamentally, that the substitution in the sale plan was distinct from any question of substitution in the FSA, and the FSA did not provide for substitution at all.\n86 I go first to substitution/assignment. The provisions of the Code relating to contracts were \"amended and modernised\" in 2016. Prior to the amendments, the Code did not contain any provisions dealing with the assignment of contracts. A new provision was introduced, Article 1216:\nA contracting party, the assignor, may assign its status as party to the contract to a third party, the assignee, with the consent of its own contractual partner, the person subject to assignment.\nThis consent may be given in advance, notably in a contract concluded between the future assignor and person subject to assignment, in which case the assignment takes effect as regards the person subject to assignment when the contract concluded between the assignor and assignee is notified to it or when it acknowledges it.\nAn assignment must be established in writing, on pain of nullity.\n87 It was submitted by Mr Podeur that the substitution for which Renault contended corresponded to the description of an assignment in Article 1216, that the asserted substitution should now be treated as an assignment of the FSA from LEG to Alvance, and that in the absence of writing it was a nullity.\n88 Mr Assaya replied that the distinction between substitution and assignment remained, and also that the consequence of lack of writing was not a nullity but that the assignment would be effective until a competent court held that it was void. For the distinction remaining he referred to a decision of the Court of Cassation dated 19 March 1997, Third Civil Chamber, No 95-12.47 (but, to be noted, prior to Article 1216), and to commentaries by Professors Charles Gijsbers and Phillipe le Torneau. Professor le Torneau's commentary includes:\nWe take the view that the substitution of a person constitutes an autonomous sui generis institution, distinct from the assignment of a contract (and by no means confined to the mandate). It is a declaratory act, creating a direct link between the extreme parties to the contract (the original principal and the substitute third party), but without removing the substitute from the legal relationship (who remains the headmaster). ... It was particularly highlighted by Professor E Jeuland. He gave a complete definition: 'The substitution of a person in a relationship of obligation is the act which allows a person, the substitute, to implement the obligation - considered in the sense of a right, duty, or potestative right - arising from a fundamental relationship between two persons, the substituted person and the unsubstituted person, without the substituted person disappearing entirely from the legal relationship and in such a way that the substitute and the unsubstituted person are directly linked to each other.\n89 I have difficulty with the proposition that the consequence of lack of writing is not nullity but requires a court decree, which Mr Assaya did not support by reference to French writings. More widely, it appears from the debate in the course of submissions (and see, for example, the learned article by Professor Cecile Lisanti, \"The substitution clause in preparatory contracts: assignment of contract clause?\" Journal of Contract Obligations, No 39, 2017 at p 45 to which LEG referred) that the juridical basis for substitution, and whether it is now to be regarded as assignment and accordingly governed by Article 1216, is unsettled and a matter of discussion amongst French scholars. With due respect to counsel, the submissions did not well equip me to come to a view with any confidence.\n90 It is not necessary to do so, because I accept the other limb of Mr Podeur's submissions. According to Professor Le Torneau's description of substitution, the substituted person remains a party to the contract. This can be seen in the stipulation in the approval of the sale plan for AR Industries that LEG \"shall remain jointly and severally liable for the performance of the commitment it has ended into\". No one suggests that LEG was the Purchaser, was replaced by Alvance, but remains directly liable to repay the financial support, directly as distinct from as guarantor. The clause in the opening of the FSA is referring to the sale plan with its substitution clause and is not a substitution clause in the FSA. Nor does the FSA there or thereafter provide for the substitution of an LEG entity as Purchaser in place of LEG. It does not record an agreement that the Purchaser is LEG but if the LEG entity is substituted in the sale plan then that entity shall be substituted as Purchaser. Rather, it records an agreement that the Purchaser will be whichever of LEG or its entity that ends up as the purchaser of the business of AR Industries under the sale plan: see in particular Article 4, that the Purchaser to acquire the operations and assets of AR Industries shall be LEG or its entity.\n91 Mr Podeur correctly says that Renault's submissions confuse the substitution of Alvance to LEG as purchaser of the activities and assets of AR Industries, and the assignment of the FSA (in his view) or alleged substitution of Alvance to LEG as party to the FSA. Alvance did not become a party to the FSA by the process of substitution.\nIssues (b) and (c): liability of Alvance under a separate contract, including the pleading issue\n92 Again, it was common ground that issue (b) was governed by French law. It is convenient to consider that issue first, being then better able to determine whether the liability as advanced by Renault has been sufficiently pleaded.\n93 In the written submissions, Renault's case was encapsulated:\nEven if [Alvance] is not a party to the FSA, the request by [Alvance] for financial support from [Renault], the extension of the financial support by [Renault] to [Alvance], and the acceptance of the financial support by [Alvance] will nevertheless give rise to parallel and identical rights and obligations (by way of a separate contract) mirroring those in the FSA. These obligations are obligations arising in relation to and/or in connection with the FSA, and would necessarily be obligations guaranteed by [LEG] under the terms of the Guarantee.\n94 The argument is effectively that put in support of liability of Alvance as party to the FSA, shorn of the addition that the contract is one of adherence to the FSA. The evidence is slim, but it is cogent.\n95 First, from the FSA it is plain that it was intended that the Purchaser, whoever it was, would repay the financial support according to the timetable (including any advancement in the event of default) in its Article 5 - and, it should not be forgotten, would receive orders for and supply wheels and comply with other commitments of the Purchaser. This was the intention of all of Renault, LEG and LHG, even if their businessman's agreement did not pay sufficient heed to binding the yet-to-be-incorporated LEG entity to those obligations if it became the Purchaser. The financial support was not a gift.\n96 Against that background, with the FSA plainly known to Alvance, Alvance requested that the instalments of the financial support be paid to it and received the instalments - it is true that the evidence of request is for the 2019 and 2020 instalments, and there is no evidence of request for the 2018 instalments, but it is hard to see payment of the 2018 instalments without request or at least willing acceptance. When it requested and/or received the instalments, Alvance could not have considered them a gift out of the blue; they were giving effect to the provision of financial support in the FSA. More than that, Alvance treated the payment of the 2019 and 2020 instalments as payments in accordance with the FSA as an agreement between it and Renault, referring albeit erroneously to the FSA as the protocol signed between them at the time of the takeover of AR Industries and as the bilateral agreement between them. When Renault paid, there is no evidence that it quibbled with that view - the inference is that it, albeit equally erroneously, also treated the payments as payments in accordance with the FSA as an agreement with Alvance. It is readily to be found in this an implicit offer and acceptance and demonstration of the will of Renault and Alvance to be bound to a contract for the receipt and performance of the respective rights and obligations of Renault and the Purchaser as set out in the FSA, for present purposes with liability to repay the financial support in accordance with its Article 5.\n97 I bear in mind that, as Mr Podeur submitted, there is no evidence of the performance of the other acts set out in the FSA, for example of Renault ordering and Alvance supplying wheels; but nor is there evidence of non-performance, and from the references in May 2019 and May 2020 to the protocol and the bilateral agreement the full extent of the respective obligations was accepted. I bear in mind also the lack of evidence of the circumstances of payment of the 2018 instalment. But LEG scarcely addressed this issue in submissions: Mr Podeur submitted that there was no evidence that Alvance accepted all the Purchaser's obligations under the FSA, but LEG's primary complaint was the pleading issue. Notwithstanding that the evidence is slim, I am satisfied that the finding abovementioned should be made.\n98 Mr Assaya's submissions included also that Alvance was bound to the terms of the FSA under a separate contract by virtue of French law concerning stipulations for the benefit of third parties. Summarising, by Article 1205 of the Code, a contract can stipulate a promise to perform an obligation for the benefit of a third party, and by Article 1206, the third party has a direct right to the benefit against the promisor, which cannot be revoked once the third party has accepted the stipulation. By Article 1208, the acceptance may be express or it may be tacit. Citing Professor Bertrand Fages, Droit des Obligations (12th Ed, 2022-2023) at para 253, it was said that the stipulation could confer on the third party the right to enter into a contract. It was submitted that LEG had obtained from Renault a promise to lend the financial support to the Purchaser, as it turned out Alvance; that Alvance had accepted the benefit of the promise by requesting and accepting the financial support; and that a loan contract for the financial support had thereby come into existence. The promise would have to go further than lending the financial support, the FSA containing many other commitments of both Renault and the Purchaser, but the difficulty with the submission is in seeing a promise by Renault not just to provide the financial support to the Purchaser and otherwise deal with it as the FSA contemplated, but to enter into a contract with it. In the view I have taken, a promise to enter into a contract is not necessary, there being the implicit offer; if a promise be seen, however, it is a clear form of offer which was accepted.\n99 I go then to the pleading issue, returning to Renault's Replies. Mr Liu relied on them for a sufficient pleading of liability under a separate contract.\n100 In the Reply in OA 3, under the heading \"The Purchaser is party to and bound by the Financial Support Agreement\", Renault first referred in para 4 to Alvance having become the purchaser under the sale plan and being the Purchaser as referred to in the FSA. It then averred in para 5 that Alvance was party to and bound by the FSA. The particulars to para 5 included that Alvance had requested from Renault and accepted payment of the financial support under the terms of the FSA, that the financial support had been paid to Alvance by Renault by the four instalments in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and:\n(d) By requesting and accepting payment under the Financial Support Agreement within the context set out at paragraph 4 above, [Alvance] has by conduct accepted and submitted to the Financial Support Agreement. In the circumstances, [Alvance] is party to and is bound by the Financial Support Agreement, and the Financial Support Agreement is enforceable against [Alvance].\n101 This was a pleading of Alvance being a party to the FSA. Later in the Reply came the heading, \"Defendant is obliged to make payment, regardless of whether [Alvance] is a party to the Financial Support Agreement\". In para 12, Renault made that averment, and after reference to the Guarantee and its definition of \"Obligations\", the pleading ran:\n15. As pleaded at paragraphs 4 to 5 above, [Renault] had extended EUR 7,000,000 in financial support to [Alvance]/the Purchaser under the terms of the Financial Support Agreement.\n16. As pleaded at paragraphs 8 to 10A above, upon the opening of the judicial liquidation of [Alvance], the entire amount of EUR 7,000,000 of financial support extended by [Renault] to [Alvance] under the terms of the Financial Support Agreement was immediately due and payable by [Alvance] to [Renault] as of 2 February 2022.\n17. Accordingly, even if [Alvance] is not a party to the Financial Support Agreement (which is denied), the EUR 7,000,000 of financial support owed by [Alvance] to [Renault] (whether under the Financial Support Agreement or otherwise) constitutes liabilities owing or incurred to [Renault] by [Alvance] in relation with the provisions of the Financial Support Agreement, which are guaranteed by [LEG] under Clause 2.1(a) of the Guarantee.\n18. Further, even if [Alvance] is not a party to the Financial Support Agreement (which is denied), the EUR 7,000,000 of financial support owed by [Alvance] to [Renault] (whether under the Financial Support Agreement or otherwise) constitutes amounts due under or in connection with the Financial Support Agreement, which [LEG] is obliged to pay immediately on demand as if it was [Alvance] under Clause 2.1(b) of the Guarantee.\n[bold in original]\n102 The Reply in OA 9, although slightly differently structured, was relevantly similar. There was first the pleading that Alvance as Purchaser was a party to the FSA and bound by its terms, the central particular to para 5 which made that averment being that it was party to and bound by the FSA because it had requested and accepted payment thereunder within the context in para 4. Then, although not under a heading that Alvance was obliged to make payment regardless of whether it was a party to the FSA, it was averred in para 10 that LEG was obliged to make payment under the Guarantee regardless of whether Alvance was a party to the FSA, and in the end:\n13. As pleaded at paragraphs 4 to 5 above, [Renault] had extended EUR 7,000,000 in financial support to [Alvance]/the Purchaser under the terms of the Financial Support Agreement. Accordingly, even if [Alvance] is not a party to the Financial Support Agreement (which is denied), the EUR 7,000,000 of financial support owed by [Alvance] to [Renault] (whether under the Financial Support Agreement or otherwise) constitutes liabilities owing or incurred to [Renault] by [Alvance] in relation with the provisions of the Financial Support Agreement, which are guaranteed by [LEG] under Clause 2.1(a) of the Guarantee.\n[bold in original]\n103 Model pleading this was not, but I have concluded that it is adequate to carry the case made by Renault for a separate contract.\n104 I have explained the raising of whether Alvance was liable to repay the financial support under the FSA and the exposure of whether it might be liable to repay the financial support on a basis which was in relation with its provisions or in connectionwith it. The pleadings made it abundantly clear that Renault alleged that, if it was not a party to the FSA, it was otherwise liable to repay the financial support. The basis for that was the extension of financial support as pleaded in the respective paras 4 and 5, from reference to those paragraphs being the request for and receipt of the financial support in the context of it being the Purchaser as referred to in the FSA. Those facts had been the basis for the allegation that Alvance was a party to the FSA but were taken up again as the basis for an alternative liability.\n105 It is sufficient for the pleader to state the material facts, and the legal conclusion to be drawn from them need not be stated: MK (Project Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy Pte Ltd [1994] 3 SLR(R) 823 at [26]. As was said by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in Acute Result Holdings Ltd v CGS-CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd (formerly known as CIMB Securities (Singapore) Pte Ltd) [2023] 5 SLR 406 at [64]:\n... I accept the plaintiff's submission that a pleader's duty is to plead facts not law. Once the material facts have been pleaded, the pleader can develop the legal consequences of those facts in submissions. I would add only the proviso that the legal consequences which the pleader develops in submissions must not take the opposing party by surprise, so as to cause it prejudice which cannot be remedied.\nMr Chew submitted, referring to Gay ChoonIng v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [47], that there must be an identifiable agreement that is complete and certain, and that this could not be seen in the pleading. However, the essential ingredients of a contract are apparent. The parties are Renault and Alvance, the provider and recipient of the financial support; the contract arose from the conduct of requesting and receiving the financial support, in the particular context, and its terms correspond to those in the FSA. It was open to Renault to develop the legal consequence of the separate contract. This could not be said to have taken LEG by surprise, nor was it prejudicial to it, when Renault relied on the same facts for Alvance having become a party to the FSA and LEG was able and to an extent did contest their consequences in terms of consensualisme.\nIssue (d): acceleration of the obligation of LEG as guarantor\n106 At the hearing LEG did not dispute that under Article L.643-1 of the French Commercial Code, the commencement of a judicial liquidation rendered all the debtor's debts immediately due and payable. If Alvance was bound by the FSA, or if it was bound under a separate contract to repay the financial support, upon the judgment of the Paris Commercial Court opening the liquidation judiciare of Alvance on 2 February 2022, its unmatured debts would be rendered due and payable.\n107 This was common ground between Mr Assaya and Mr Podeur. It was also common ground that under French law the acceleration of the debts upon the liquidation judiciare of a debtor is not enforceable against a guarantor, unless otherwise agreed between the parties. The issue, then, came down to whether it had been \"otherwise agreed\" that LEG would be bound by the acceleration of Alvance's debts triggered by the operation of Article L.643-1.\n108 Mr Assaya cited from Pierre-Michel Le Corre, Law & Practice of the Collective Proceedings Involving a Debtor and his Creditors (Dalloz, 12th Ed, 2022) at para 721.181 where, after describing that a guarantee has its own term (as I understand it, in the sense of when the guarantor can be called upon to pay), the learned author continues:\nHowever, the guarantor's own term is a purely suppletive rule. It benefits the guarantor if the guarantee agreement is silent on this point. It can be validly set aside by an express stipulation to this effect, without it being necessary for it to appear in the handwritten note affixed by the guarantor. In the case of bank guarantees, this is a clause that has become standard, known as the 'waiver of the benefit of a specific term' clause. In such a case, the guarantor who has waived the benefit of its own term will follow the principal debtor's term. If the principal debtor is subject to acceleration of the term, either by agreement or as a result of liquidation, the guarantor will also be subject to acceleration of the term as an accessory matter. However, in order for the acceleration of the term to come into effect, the creditor must allege the existence of this clause waiving the benefit of a specific term.\n109 For his part, Mr Podeur cited from a commentary on the Code by Professor P. Simler, in which the learned author states:\nThe non-enforceability, against the guarantor, of the acceleration of the debts affecting the principal debtor is based, as has been pointed out, on compliance with contractual provisions, that is to say on Article 1103 (former Art 1134) of the Civil Code. As this is a supplementary rule, it can, therefore be freely waived by a clause in the guarantee contract. This is often the case.\nOn the face of it, no major difficulty can arise if the waiver is the result of a clear and explicit stipulation in the guarantee contract.\n110 Article 1103 of the Code is the Article which gives binding force to contracts. From these citations, the authors appear to differ on whether a waiver must be found in the guarantee itself. The difference was not clarified in submissions.\n111 Mr Assaya submitted that the parties, that is, Renault and LEG, had \"otherwise agreed\" by forms of \"waiver of the benefit of a specific term\" clause, the waiver being found in Article 10 of the FSA and in cl. 2.1(b) of the Guarantee, and even by the fact that the Guarantee was signed after and with knowledge of the FSA. Mr Podeur responded that Article 10 of the FSA was irrelevant because it was not part of the Guarantee, while submitting that neither Article 10 of the FSA nor cl 2.1(b) of the Guarantee gave rise to an acceleration of LEG's obligation to pay Renault, and that \"otherwise agreement\" could not be found simply in signature of the Guarantee with knowledge of the FSA.\nArticle 10 of the FSA\n112 Again, for convenience I set out the relevant part of Article 10:\nMoreover, in case i) the Purchaser is an entity of Liberty Engineering's Group substituted to Liberty Engineering in the benefit of the Sale Plan, and ii) a bankruptcy proceedings is opened towards the Purchaser (sauvegarde, redressment judiciare or liquidation judiciare) and/or iii) the Purchaser fails to reimburse the Financial Support in due time (as referred to in Article 5) for any reason whatsoever, Liberty Engineering, as Guarantor 2, commits to reimburse to Renault the Financial Support paid to the Purchaser, on first demand, in place of the Purchaser, within the same schedule . For the sake of clarity, it is specified that in case the amount of the Financial Support already paid becomes immediately refundable by the Purchaser, it will also become immediately refundable by the Guarantor 2.\nTo this end, Liberty House Group, and Liberty Engineering, each as far as it is concerned, commit to provide Renault, within 10 business days, following the signing of the Agreement, with (i) a first demand guarantee duly approved by their competent, corporate bodies...\n[emphasis added in bold]\n113 Mr Assaya submitted that by the words emphasised in bold, LEG had agreed that in the event of the liquidation judiciare of Alvance it would reimburse Renault \"within the same schedule\", and in the event of the financial support becoming immediately refundable by Alvance it would also be immediately refundable by LEG: that is, that if repayment by Alvance was accelerated, so also was payment by LEG accelerated.\n114 Quite apart from whether French law requires that the waiver be in the guarantee itself, I doubt that regard can be had to the Article for whatever status it may have as a \"waiver of the benefit of a specific term\" clause. That is because, as the latter part of Article 10 says, LEG is to provide a guarantee to Renault, and it is to the guarantee that Renault and LEG must look for their respective rights and obligations. In the Suit 1 Judgment I explained at [41]-[42] that the Guarantee was \"a quite different animal from the First Demand Guarantee 2 outlined in Article 10\", and that it was to be construed on its own terms; similarly, when its terms differ from what was contemplated as the First Demand Guarantee 2, those are the terms to operate between Renault and LEG. But even if that be incorrect, I do not think that the words emphasised in bold are an agreement upon acceleration of LEG's liability if Alvance's liability is accelerated. As was common ground in Suit 1, the opening of bankruptcy proceedings towards the Purchaser did not accelerate repayment by it or make the financial support immediately refundable, so an agreement to reimburse \"according to the same schedule\" in that event was not agreement upon acceleration of LEG's liability. Failure by the Purchaser to reimburse the financial support in due time, meaning according to the payment schedule in Article 5, would make the whole of the financial support already paid immediately refundable, and there would be a corresponding liability of LEG, but that was not the situation in February 2022. That is, the \"agreement otherwise\" was not a waiver of the benefit of a specific term either across the board or in the situation of the acceleration of Alvance's debts upon its liquidation judiciare .\n115 It is therefore unnecessary to resolve whether a waiver must be found in the guarantee itself.\nClause 2.1(b) of the Guarantee\n116 Again, for convenience, cl 2.1(b) reads that the guarantor:\nundertakes that (i) whenever the Purchaser does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with the Financial Support Document, or (ii) upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event, the Guarantor shall immediately on demand by the Financial Support Provider pay that amount to the Financial Support Provider as if it were the Purchaser ...\n[emphasis added in bold]\n117 Mr Assaya submitted that the effect of the words emphasised in bold was that if Alvance's debt was accelerated, so also was LEG's liability as guarantor accelerated. Mr Podeur said otherwise, submitting in particular to the effect that in the case of a Bankruptcy Event there was not an acceleration of either the Purchaser's obligation to repay the financial support or the guarantor's liability under the Guarantee, so the words could not be seen as adoption of any acceleration of the Purchaser's debts. The construction of the Guarantee is governed by Singapore law, but neither Mr Liu nor Mr Chew intervened.\n118 Although its construction is governed by Singapore law, what must be found in the Guarantee is what is required by French law, agreement to waive the ordinary position that the acceleration of the debts of the debtor is not enforceable against the guarantor. That is the waiver of a valuable right, and I do not think that it should be found lightly, in which I am fortified by Professor Simler's reference to a clear and explicit stipulation in the guarantee contract: in a footnote, the Professor cites a case where the guarantor had agreed to pay \"as soon as the debt becomes enforceable for any reason whatsoever, particularly in case of acceleration of maturity\".\n119 I do not think that the words emphasised in bold are such a stipulation. Commonly it is enough to say, in the form found in cl 2.1(a), that the guarantor guarantees performance of the debtor's obligations. Clause 2.1(b) overlaps with this, in the different form that in the events stated the guarantor will pay in place of the debtor. The words in bold emphasise that the guarantor will pay in place of the debtor, but do not clearly go beyond that status of the guarantor and mean that the guarantor will do so according to any accelerated obligation of the debtor.\nSignature with knowledge\n120 Mr Assaya referred to a decision of the Court of Cassation dated 13 May 2003, Commercial Chamber, No 00-15.642, in which the guarantors asserted that their \"waiver of the unenforceability of the forfeiture of the term\" could only result from express waiver, but the Court said:\nHowever, the guarantor's express waiver of the unenforceability of the term forfeiture clause included in the loan agreement is not a condition for the guarantor's enforceability of the clause; whereas the judgement holds that the guarantors undertook to pay the sums due by the principal debtor company after having read the terms of the loan agreement, in particular, the clause forfeiting the term in the event of non-compliance with the deadlines and that it follows that they have tacitly agreed to pay as soon as the term has lapsed ...\n121 Mr Assaya submitted, in reliance on this decision, that the agreement to waive the benefit of a specific term could be deduced from the mere fact that the guarantor agreed to the guarantee after having read the terms of the agreement between the debtor and the beneficiary of the guarantee that provided that the debt will become immediately due and payable in certain circumstances. Mr Podeur responded to the effect that this would negate the principle that the acceleration of debts upon the liquidation judiciare of a debtor is not enforceable against a guarantor unless otherwise agreed, and that the decision should not be viewed as reflecting French law.\n122 Again, the submissions did not well equip me to come to a view on Mr Assaya's proposition as a matter of French law. It appears, however, that the loan agreement contained a clause \"forfeiting the term in the event of non-compliance with the deadlines\", being a clause providing for acceleration of the debtor's obligation in the particular circumstance, and so there must be found in the present case a clause in the FSA providing for acceleration of the Purchaser's obligation to repay the financial support in the event of the liquidation judiciare of the Purchaser. There is no such clause; to the contrary, a Bankruptcy Event does not accelerate repayment. The reliance on the decision is misplaced.\n123 I add that LEG's written submissions included that the judgment of the Paris Commercial Court converting the redressment judiciare into liquidation judiciare has not been recognised in Singapore, therefore the acceleration of debts resulting from Article L.643-1 of the Commercial Code cannot be validly invoked by Renault in this Singaporean court. Mr Podeur repeated the argument in his oral submissions, but Mr Chew whose place it was to make it did not take it further, and Mr Liu did not respond to it. The submission may not be open when the effect of Article L.643-1 of the Commercial Code was admitted in the Defence in OA 3. It is not necessary for me to address the matter.\nRecovery under cl 2.1(c) of the Guarantee\n124 The Reply in OA 9 included a pleading to the effect that LEG was obliged to indemnify Renault in the amount of \u20ac5,250,025.61, pursuant to cl 2.1(c) of the Guarantee, for its loss and damage suffered because Alvance \"is insolvent and has entered judicial liquidation\" and the claim against it was unenforceable and/or ineffective. Renault's written submissions so contended.\n125 This was not a matter raised by Mr Liu in his formulation of the issues at the hearing. On enquiry whether the pleaded claim was maintained, there was some confusion. Ultimately Mr Liu said that he was not relying on cl 2.1(c) because, as I understand it, he considered that if there was no debt of Alvance, it could not be said that the claim against it was unenforceable or ineffective as a result of its liquidation; and implicitly, if there was a debt, he did not need to rely on cl 2.1(c).\n126 I express no view as to this position. For a separate reason the pleaded claim under cl 2.1(c) could not succeed. Whether or not Alvance owes money to Renault, Renault must show a loss suffered because of the insolvency and liquidation of Alvance, the cause (according to the pleading) of the unenforceability and ineffectiveness. In its own Statement of Case it alleged, and the evidence established, that its proof of claim for \u20ac7 million had been \"approved\" and entered on the list of claims concerning Alvance. How this was meant to be part of Renault's case is unclear, and it was not referred to in the submissions in support of Alvance's liability to repay the financial support; but it indicates that Renault may recover some or all of the now balance of the \u20ac7 million in the liquidation of Alvance. There was no evidence enabling a finding as to any shortfall in recovery. Renault has not shown the suffering of loss.\nLiability \"in relation with\" the provisions of the FSA or \"in connection with\" the FSA\n127 In the Suit 1 Judgment at [41] the definition of \"Obligations\" in the Guarantee was said to be very wide. That observation was not particularly directed to the reference to money and liabilities, including debts, both under the provisions of the FSA and in relation with its provisions, but the latter phrase must be given effect: see Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at [20] (cited more fully in the Suit 1 Judgment at [45] in a slightly different connection):\n... in construing, a contract, all parts of it must be given effect where possible, and no part of it should be treated as inoperative or surplus. This means, as explained in Lewison at para 7.03, p 198, that, in general, each part of the document is taken to have been deliberately inserted, having regard to all the other parts of the document, with the result that there is a presumption against redundant words. The courts should not adopt an interpretation of a contract which would render the language of a particular clause redundant.\n128 The words \"in relation with\" equate with the more usual \"in relation to\", and that phrase is one of wide import; so also the phrase \"in connection with\". The particular scope of the phrases depends on their context and their purpose in the statute or agreement in which they are used. The FSA identifies its signatories and refers to an entity which might be the Purchaser rather than LEG, which entity is not a signatory to the FSA. The addition of \"in relation with\" therefore serves to catch obligations of the Purchaser although it is not a signatory to the FSA, and the addition of \"in connection with\" similarly serves to catch amounts due from the Purchaser although it is not a signatory to the FSA, provided there is a relevant relationship or connection between the obligations and the provisions of the FSA or between the amounts due and the FSA.\n129 Here there is. The FSA is an agreement between Renault, LEG and LHG concerning the provision of financial support to the Purchaser and the ordering from and supply of wheels by the Purchaser, with many provisions governing how those matters should occur. When (relevantly) the financial support is paid to Alvance as Purchaser, as between the parties to the FSA something occurring in fulfilment of the FSA in that respect, it is to be repaid as contemplated in the FSA. The corresponding repayment obligation under the separate contract made between Renault and Alvance has a clear relationship with the provisions of the FSA or in connection with the FSA.\n130 If it be that they are maintained, I do not accept the submissions to the contrary in LEG's written submissions. Their substance was that \"in relation with\" in the definition of Obligations and \"in connection with\" in cl 2.1(b) should be construed only to extend LEG's obligations as guarantor to compensation to Renault for breaches of the FSA such as in relation to the supply of wheels, in addition to obligations as guarantor for repayment of the financial support. To interpret the phrases as Renault sought, it was said, would mean that \"a guarantor will have to contend with the possibility that it may have inadvertently and unwittingly agreed to guarantee independent obligations, falling outside the scope of the underlying agreement between the lender and primary obligor\". This is not persuasive. First, it is the Guarantee which is being construed, not some generic guarantee. Secondly, the guarantee here is not of independent obligations unconnected with the FSA, but of obligations with a relevant relationship with its provisions or in connection with it - the Guarantee requires the relationship or connection, and if there is a question it is whether the relationship or connection exists. Thirdly, if the Purchaser is a party to the FSA the extensions of \"in relation with\" or \"in connection with\" is not needed for LEG's obligations as guarantor to include compensation to Renault for breaches such as in relation to the supply of wheels, any more than it is needed for repayment of the financial support, since the breaches would create liabilities under the FSA: the extensions cater for such breaches and repayment of the financial support alike where the Purchaser is not a party to the FSA.\nConclusion\n131 So ends a lengthy and rather untidy dispute. In OA 9 Renault has judgment for \u20ac5,250,025.61 and should have interest at 5.33 per cent from 9 June 2023. OA 3 is dismissed.\n132 If there is no agreement as to costs (both their disposition and their amount) within 28 days, the parties should file their respective written submissions within a further 14 days and their replies to the other party's submissions within a further 7 days; costs will be decided on the papers.",

        "text": "1One of two co-owners of a video game licensed its distribution in China to a licensee by a software licencing agreement. Subsequently, the two co-owners and the licensee executed a supplementary agreement by which the second co-owner was added as a co-licensor under the software licensing agreement. The first co-owner thereafter acted on behalf of the second co-owner. In time, the second co-owner had concerns about the licensee's conduct and commenced an arbitration under the arbitration clause in that agreement. Shortly after it did so, the first co-owner, who by then was a subsidiary of the licensee, entered into an extension agreement to extend the term of the licence with the licensee, purportedly acting under the same source of authority originally granted by the second co-owner so as to bind it. In addition to extending the term of the licence, the extension agreement provided for a different seat and different institution for any arbitration. Both the licensee and the first co-owner thereafter objected to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal on the ground that the parties' entry into the new arbitration agreement by the extension agreement had put an end to its jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal rejected this objection on the basis that the new arbitration agreement had been made in breach of the first co-owner's fiduciary duty to the second co-owner.\n2Upon challenge of the award to this court, our task is to determine for ourselves whether the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction. This task involves considering whether the first co-owner's authority is governed by Korean law or by Singapore law and, depending on the governing law, what duties if any the first co-owner owed to the second co-owner when purportedly agreeing on its behalf to change the arbitral seat and institution after the latter had commenced arbitration against the licensee at the originally agreed seat and institution.\n3This consolidated set of originating summonses comprises applications to set aside the partial award on liability (the \"First Partial Award\" and the award on costs arising from the findings made in the First Partial Award, the \"Second Partial Award\", collectively with the First Partial Award, the \"Partial Awards\") issued by a three-member arbitral tribunal in an arbitration commenced under the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") Arbitration Rules 2017 (\"ICC Rules\") and seated in Singapore in ICC Arbitration Case No. 22820/PTA/HTG (the \"Present Arbitration\").\n4The asserted ground for setting aside is that the tribunal in the Present Arbitration (the \"Tribunal\") lacked jurisdiction over the entire dispute because the ICC Clause (see [22] below) pursuant to which the Present Arbitration had been commenced was superseded on 30 June 2017 by the Shanghai International Arbitration Centre (\"SHIAC\")Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement (see [43] below), thus terminating the mandate of the Tribunal. The Tribunal rejected this argument on the basis that the entry into the 2017 Extension Agreement by CNA had happened in breach of fiduciary duty.\n5In SIC/OS 2/2022 and SIC/OS 5/2022, the plaintiff bringing the setting aside applications against the Partial Awards is CNA. In SIC/OS 3/2022 and SIC/OS 4/2022, the plaintiffs bringing the setting aside applications against the Partial Awards are CND and CNE. For SIC/OS 2 to 5 of 2022, the defendants are CNB and CNC.\n6CNA is an entity incorporated in the Republic of Korea (\"Korea\") and listed on the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (\"KOSDAQ\"). CNA's principal business is the development of PC and mobile games.[1]\n7CND is an entity incorporated in the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\"). It is the wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CNE, an entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands. CNE was formerly known by a different name.[2] CND and CNE were members of a corporate group (\"CNE Group\") which is a leading developer, operator and publisher of online games in the PRC.[3]\n8CNB is an entity incorporated in Korea and also listed on the KOSDAQ.[4] CNB is engaged in the business of developing and providing services related to Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (\"MMORPG\") and mobile game software. CNC is an entity incorporated in Korea and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNB. CNC was established on 23 May 2017 by way of a vertical spin-off from CNB.[5]\n9CNA and CNB are co-owners of the intellectual property rights in the MMORPG game [X] series. As a result of the spin-off (see [8] above), CNC succeeded to CNB's intellectual property rights to the game [X] series, which thereafter made CNA and CNC co-owners of the intellectual property rights in the game [X] series.\n10In 2005, CNE, through a related company, became the largest shareholder in CNA, holding 38.1% of its shares. As at the date of commencement of the Present Arbitration, CNE owned 51.09% of CNA through its wholly-owned BVI subsidiary.[6]\n11In mid-1997, a group of computer club students in a Korean university, led by Mr P, developed the first iteration of the game [X]. Mr P established CNA. The student developers held a 51% stake in CNA, while an investor, Mr H, held the remaining 49% stake.[7] The game [X] was launched in November 1998. The relationship between Mr P and Mr H broke down in 1999, and Mr P left CNA to establish his own business, CNB, in early 2000. CNA acquired 40% of the shares in CNB, while Mr P held 60% of its shares.\n12Following the acquisition of shares, CNA and CNB entered into a series of agreements to regulate their relationship as co-owners of the copyright in the products in the game series, which includes the sequel game [X2]. The development of the game [X2] was completed around September 2000.\n15On 18 February 2000, CNA and CNB entered into the Basic Agreement (the \"Basic Agreement\"). Article 2 of the Basic Agreement provided that \"[CNA] and [CNB] shall cooperate with each other with regard to the joint development of the '[game [X]]' series and execute a separate joint development agreement\".[19]\n16On 23 February 2000, CNA and CNB entered into the Domestic Agreement to regulate their respective roles in the development and dealership of the game [X].[20] The salient terms of the Domestic Agreement were as follows:\nArticle 1 (Purpose): [CNA] shall support upgrading and developing [game [X]] Series, and [CNB] shall make every effort and use all reasonable skill and care.\nArticle 2 (Recognition of Sales Revenues): The sales revenues on [game [X]] Series shall be recognized as [CNA's] profits.\nArticle 3 (Commission): [CNA] shall pay fifty (50) percent of the sales revenues on [game [X]] Series as the commission to [CNB]. If [CNB] develops [game [X]] Series, and the total number of concurrent users exceed ten thousand (10,000) persons after Beta Service or commercialized pay service, [CNA] shall pay sixty (60) percent of sales revenues on [game [X]] Series as commission to [CNB] to improve the quality of operation service from the following month.\nArticle 9 (Ownership of Developed Products): [CNA] and [CNB] shall own [game [X]] Series products in a ratio of half and half during the term of Agreement, and [CNA] shall assign the ownership to [CNB] from the expiration of the term of Agreement under the other Agreement separately entered into.\nArticle 10 (Operation of Developed Products): [CNB] shall hold all the rights to operate and manage matters related to the developed products. In respect of this, [CNA] shall sincerely cooperate with [CNB], and [CNB] shall abide by the good faith.\n17Subsequently, CNA and CNB entered into the Overseas Agreement dated 26 February 2001. Pursuant to Art 2 of the Overseas Agreement, the applicability of the Domestic Agreement was limited to sales within Korea. The Overseas Agreement set out terms pertaining to the joint development and overseas sales of the game series. It recognised the overseas sales of the game series as the revenue of CNA, and set out the commission structure and the development fee payments for CNB. The key terms of the Overseas Agreement were as follows:\nArticle 3. Purport of Development\n[CNA] shall support the upgrade and development of the \"[game [X]]\" series and [CNB] shall exert its best efforts with due care as a good manager.\nArticle 4. Recognition of Sales\nThe overseas sales of the \"[game [X]]\" series shall be entirely recognized as the revenue of [CNA].\nArticle 5. Payment of Commission for Sales Entrustment\n(1) [CNA] shall pay [CNB] 60% of the overseas sales revenue from the \"[game [X]]\" series as commission for sales entrustment.\n(2) However, in the case of an overseas market which is developed by [CNA] and where an overseas service agreement has been executed by [CNA], [CNA] shall pay [CNB] 50% of the overseas sales revenue for the relevant area as commission for sales entrustment.\nArticle 6. Amount and Term of Payment of Development Fee\n(1) [CNA] shall pay [CNB] 20% of the overseas sales revenue as development fee until December 31, 2004 in order to encourage development and continuous upgrade of the \"[game [X]]\" series.\n(2) Expenses incurred in connection with the development and improvement of jointly developed products shall be borne by [CNB].\nArticle 11. Ownership of Developed Products\nThe \"[game [X]]\" series shall be jointly owned by both parties in equal proportion during the term of this Agreement, and the ownership shall be transferred to [CNB] after the term of this Agreement in accordance with a separate agreement.\nArticle 12. Operation of Developed Products\nAll rights to operation and maintenance related to the developed products shall reside with [CNB]. [CNA] shall dutifully cooperate therewith, and [CNB] shall comply with the principle of good faith.\n[emphasis in original]\nIn accordance with Art 14 of the Overseas Agreement, it was effective until 31 December 2004.\n18There were subsequent clarifications to Art 9 of the Domestic Agreement, and to the definition of terms in the Overseas Agreement.\n19On 23 May 2001, CNA and CNB entered into another agreement[21] to clarify the purpose of Art 9 and the intent behind Art 9 and Art 12 of the Domestic Agreement. It was explained that Art 9 was \"symbolically inserted to enhance [CNB's] confidence as a game developer\" and expressed generally the possibility of the transfer of joint ownership to CNB in the event that parties mutually agree (at cl 1). Further, it was provided that \"[n]otwithstanding [Art 9 and Art 12], ... both parties shall maintain their cooperative relationship even after December 31, 2003\" and that \"both parties shall operate their businesses by mutual and peaceful agreements in accordance with the ground understandings of the Basic Agreement\" (at cl 2). These clarificatory provisions were to apply to all agreements executed between CNA and CNB after 18 February 2000.\n20On 1 August 2001, CNA and CNB signed another agreement[22] to clarify, inter alia, that \"overseas sales\" referred to \"the amount [payable] under an agreement entered into by and between any party [ie, CNA or CNB] and a third party from a foreign nation\". This provided clarification that the Overseas Agreement also allowed CNB to itself establish an agreement with an overseas party, and share profits with CNA, according to the terms in the Overseas Agreement.\n21On 29 June 2001, CNA, solely in its name, entered into the Software Licensing Agreement (the \"SLA\") with the predecessors of CND and CNE.[23] Under the SLA, CNE was granted the sole and exclusive licence to \"use, promote, distribute, market, adapt or modify, and convert the Chinese-language version of the [computer game [X2] delivered in CD-ROM and internet and related documentation, images and films, published specifications and trademark, logo and artwork related to the game series]\". The licence was valid for a minimum of two years and would automatically extend for a further term of one year unless either party sent a written notice to the other stating that it did not want to renew the SLA within 60 days prior to its expiration. In return, CNE agreed to pay a non-refundable licensing fee of US$300,000 upon signing the SLA and a monthly royalty fee in the amount of 27% of the revenue from sales of the game [X2].\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed by in accordance with the laws of Singapore. All disputes arising under this Agreement shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in Singapore in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.\n23Following the SLA, the Chinese-language version of the game [X2] was launched around late 2001 in the PRC to resounding success. By 2002, the game [X2] accounted for 60% of the online game market in the PRC. It remains one of the most popular MMORPG in the PRC.\n24Following the success of the game [X2], in or around December 2001, bugs and cheating programs started to interfere with its operation. CNE approached CNA to seek assistance to resolve the technical issues pursuant to cl 5.04 of the SLA, which provided that throughout the term of the SLA, the \"Licensor\" was responsible for providing technical services in connection with the installation and on-site maintenance of, inter alia, the computer game [X2].\n25However, CNA was unable to assist as it relied on CNB to resolve technical issues pursuant to the cooperative arrangements between CNA and CNB where CNB was responsible for the day-to-day servicing of the game [X2]. CNB was not a signatory to the SLA. CNE was displeased to learn that while it was contractually entitled to technical support from the \"Licensor\" (ie, CNA under the SLA), CNA relied on CNB to fulfil this obligation. CNE also alleged that CNA had materially misrepresented its status as the sole owner of, inter alia, the computer game [X2], licensed under the SLA. In light of this development, discussions ensued between the parties concerning how to resolve the dispute.\n26On 14 July 2002, CNA, CNB and CNE entered into a Supplementary Agreement to the SLA (ie, the 2002 Supplementary Agreement), which detailed CNB's obligation, as co-licensor, to CNE to resolve technical problems that might affect the servicing and normal operation of the computer game [X2] in the PRC.\n27In the preamble to the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, it was provided that the SLA would remain effective until 28 September 2003 and CNB would \"perform relevant obligations in respect of the technical support\". It further stated that \"[CNA] and [CNE] have agreed to accept [CNB] as [the game [X2]]'s co-Licensor, and [CNB] will entrust [CNA] with the exercise of all its rights as co-Licensor, and the entrustment is irrevocable during the term of the [SLA] and [the 2002] Supplementary Agreement\" (the \"Entrustment Recitation\"). The Supplementary Agreement therefore introduced CNB as a co-licensor to provide technical support for the computer game [X2], but its rights as co-licensor were to be entrusted to CNA so that CNE could continue dealing only with CNA.\n28The terms of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement related to CNE's rights to the upgraded version of the game [X2], CNE's payment of the royalties it had withheld, and CNB's obligations to CNE to solve technical problems that may affect the otherwise normal operation of the game in an active manner in accordance with the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. Clause 8 of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement stated that the conclusion of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement did not in any way affect the validity of any clause in the SLA nor the lawful acquisition of any rights that the parties to the SLA were entitled to.\n29The disputes between CNA, CNB and CNE continued despite the signing of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. These included concerns about persistent bugs and cheating programs which affected the operation of the game [X2], and the leak of the source code of the game [X2]. Consequently, CNE elected to stop paying royalties. In turn, CNA sent notice of termination of the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement to CNE on the basis of non-payment of royalties. CNE denied the effectiveness of the termination. CNB, on the other hand, wrote to CNA, stating that it did not have any intention to maintain the SLA and the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. CNB also informed CNA that it should not withdraw its notice of termination or renew the SLA. This precipitated an arbitration commenced by CNE against CNA and CNB pursuant to the ICC Clause in the SLA (the \"2003 ICC Arbitration\").\n30Between 2003 and 2004, multiple proceedings in the Korean courts were brought by CNA and CNB against each other. There were over 20 lawsuits filed between the parties during that time.[24]\n31On 29 April 2004, CNA and CNB agreed to settle all pending litigation in the Korean courts by way of a settlement agreement reviewed, approved, recorded and sealed by the Seoul Central District Court (ie, the 2004 Settlement Record).[25] The 2004 Settlement Record contained terms on the allocation of sales and revenue recognition for overseas sales and agreements entered into by each party with respect to the game [X2] and the threequel, the game [X3], as well as each party's right to separately execute licence agreements with third parties in relation to the game [X2] and the game [X3].\n32The pertinent clauses of the 2004 Settlement Record are set out below:\n(a)Clause 1: CNA acknowledged the existing licence agreement between CNB and a third-party PRC licensee, and CNB acknowledged the existing agreement between CNA and CNE (ie, the SLA).\n(b)Clauses 3 and 7(B): When entering into an agreement with a new counterparty overseas with respect to [the game [X2]] and [the game [X3]], the sales shall be allocated between CNA and CNB in the ratio of 30:70 if the deal was sourced by CNA and from its agreement with CNE, or in the ratio of 20:80 if the deal was sourced by CNB and from the agreement with the third-party PRC licensee. The right to recognise sales would be vested in either party who had sourced the deal.\n(c)Clause 7(A): The right to renew the existing agreements with CNE (ie, the SLA) was vested in CNA, and the right to renew the existing agreements with, inter alia, the third-party PRC licensee, shall be vested in CNB, \"provided, however, that [CNA] and [CNB] shall consult with each other when renewing any of such agreements\" [emphasis in original omitted, emphasis in italics added].\n33Subsequent to the 2003 Amendment Agreement (see [47] below), the SLA was assigned, amended and extended several more times over the years, by CNA entering into an agreement with CNE or their assignees. CNB was not a party to these agreements, save for the 2009 Supplementary Agreement.\n34The 2009 Supplementary Agreement was madebetween CNA, CNB and CNE to set out the terms and conditions under which CNB would provide specified textual and/or graphical content pertaining to the game [X2] and technical support directly to CNE.[26]\n35Whilst CNB was not a party to the other agreements, it was consulted on the following:\n(a)2005 Extension Agreement: On 22 September 2005, CNA, CNE and an import agent entered into the 2005 Extension Agreementwhich extended the SLA to 28 September 2008, with a further automatic extension to 28 September 2009 if there were no disputes between CNA and CNE. The upfront licence fee was US$3 million. Before this court, it was not disputed that there had been discussions between CNA and CNB prior to the execution of the 2005 Extension Agreement.\n(b)2008 Extension Agreement: On 26 November 2008, CNA, CNE and the import agent entered into the 2008 Extension Agreementwhich extended the SLA to 28 September 2015 with a further automatic extension to 28 September 2017 if there were no disputes between CNE and CNA with regards to the licence. The upfront licence fee was US$7 million. CNB and CNA discussed this extension in written correspondence from 13 November 2008 to 24 November 2008.[27]\n37However, around that same period, CNB discovered that CND (acting on behalf of CNE) or CNE did not merely use the authorisation letters it previously provided to them to police the infringing activities in the PRC (which was the basis upon which the letters were sought). Instead, these authorisation letters were used to grant \"sub-licences\" for the game [X2] PC-client, web and mobile games. This was in breach of CNE's limited licence under the SLA, which CND / CNE acknowledged in early 2015 to mid-2016. Pursuant to the concession, CND / CNE agreed to inform CNB of all the \"sub-licences\" which had been granted, and to remit the profits made to CNB and CNC.[28]\n38There were reconciliatory efforts between parties to continue with the licensing arrangement. On 6 January 2016, CND / CNE entered into two separate mobile games licence agreements with CNB and CNA respectively to develop and service a derivative mobile version of the game [X2]. Unfortunately, the concessionary promises made by CND / CNE were not kept.\n41After the commencement of the Present Arbitration, CNC summarised the previous correspondence between parties and detailed the evidence it had of the breaches by CND and/or CNE of the SLA, and sent this to CNA by letter on 26 May 2017. CNC also indicated in another letter to CNA on 29 May 2017 that it did not intend to renew or extend the SLA, and urged CNA to do the same. CNA forwarded CNC's letters to CND and CNE in order for them to confirm if the details were true and to express their position.[29] On 16 June 2017, CND responded to CNA to deny the allegations.[30] On 22 June 2017, CNA informed CNB that it took the view that \"[CNE] has stated a sufficiently reasonable opinion with regard to the questions raised by [CNB]\".[31] The next day, CNA indicated to CNB / CNC that it was negotiating the renewal of the SLA with CND and/or CNE.[32]\n42On 27 June 2017, CNB / CNC applied for injunctive relief before the Korean courts to restrain CNA from renewing the SLA. At the time, the Tribunal had not yet been constituted.\n(a)Clause 1: The term of the SLA, which was due to expire on 28 September 2017, was extended to 28 September 2023. It would be automatically extended to 28 September 2025 if there were no new disputes with respect to the game [X2] between CNA and CND. CND would pay to CNA upfront licence fees of US$11 million (which was more than 50% higher than the licence fee payable under the 2008 Extension Agreement).\n(b)Clause 2: The SLA, amendments to the SLA and the 2017 Extension Agreement would be governed by PRC law, with all disputes arising under the SLA, amendments to the SLA and the 2017 Extension Agreement to be submitted to final and binding arbitration before the SHIAC seated in Shanghai, PRC (the \"SHIAC Clause\").\n(c)Clause 5: The 2017 Extension Agreement would become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, ie,on 30 June 2017.\n45Given the nature and length of parties' relationship, it comes as no surprise that parties have commenced numerous proceedings against each other in multiple forums across a number of jurisdictions. For the purpose of these applications, however, we set out the circumstances and decision of the tribunal of the 2003 ICC Arbitration.\n46On 4 July 2003, pursuant to the ICC Clause, CNE commenced an arbitration against CNA and CNB to challenge the effectiveness of their termination notices given on 24 January 2003 and 12 November 2002 respectively. In its claim, CNE sought damages for breach of contract.\n48On 29 August 2003, CNE informed the ICC that it had settled with CNA and was withdrawing the 2003 ICC Arbitration against CNA and CNB.[34] On 8 September 2003, CNB filed its Answer with Counterclaim against CNE and objected to this on the basis that CNB was not a party to the 2003 Settlement Agreement and the 2003 Amendment Agreement - therefore, the disputes between CNE and CNB had not been settled.[35] On 20 October 2003, CNB filed cross-claims against CNA, alleging, inter alia, that CNA had acted in breach of the Overseas Agreement.\n49Parties exchanged their respective submissions on jurisdiction in the 2003 ICC Arbitration on 9 December 2004.\n51The 2005 Interim Award found that the Domestic Agreement and the Overseas Agreement governed CNB and CNA's relationship inter se (at [122]). Although the 2002 Supplementary Agreement was taken to have incorporated the ICC Clause in the SLA, CNB's cross-claims fell within the scope of the Domestic Agreement and the Overseas Agreement, and not the 2002 Supplementary Agreement (at [124]). The tribunal held that the 2002 Supplementary Agreement primarily regulated \"the licensing arrangements by both [CNA] and [CNB] (as one interest bloc) with [CNE]\" (at [123]). Consequently, the tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction over CNB's cross-claims against CNA, which were issues arising out of the Domestic Agreement and Overseas Agreement that governed their relationship as co-licensors (at [124]).\n53CNB commenced the Present Arbitration on 18 May 2017 against CND and CNE for their breaches of the SLA under the ICC Clause. Following CNC's succession to all of CNB's rights and obligations in respect of the game [X2], including the SLA, CNB submitted a request on 30 August 2017 to join CNC as a co-claimant and CNA as an additional respondent.\n56The Tribunal in the Present Arbitration was constituted on 27 December 2017.\n57On 3 January 2018, CNB / CNC applied to the Tribunal for, inter alia, interim injunctive relief for the withdrawal of the SHIAC Arbitration or to restrain CND / CNE from continuing with the SHIAC Arbitration until further order by the Tribunal. Following the issuance of the SHIAC award, CNB / CNC applied to amend the relief to include restraining the enforcement of the SHIAC award or reliance on the SHIAC award to make representations to third parties. Interim relief was granted against CND / CNE on 26 March 2018 to prevent enforcement and reliance on the SHIAC award.[40] The Tribunal declined to make any order against CNA.\n58The parties then filed their respective memorials on jurisdictional challenges and liability.\n60As to liability on the merits, CNB / CNC claimed that CND and CNE breached the SLA by authorising and/or facilitating third parties to develop and exploit unauthorised web, mobile and PC-client versions of the game [X2]. This claim was premised on the limited scope of the SLA, which conferred on CND only the right to use, promote or distribute the game [X2] in PC-client format and to sub-license to six permitted sub-licensees. Against CNA, CNB / CNC alleged that it had procured or induced and/or actively assisted CND and CNE in their breaches of the SLA. CNB / CNC also claimed that CNA, CND and CNE conspired to injure by unlawful means in amending the dispute resolution and governing law clause via the 2017 Extension Agreement and by procuring the SHIAC award.\n(a)The 2017 Extension Agreement was invalid. As the source of CNA's authority to renew or extend the SLA arose from the Entrustment Recitation in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement which was governed by Singapore law, CNA was an agent of CNB/CNC and owed fiduciary duties to them in the exercise of their rights as co-licensors to, inter alia, act in the joint interests of itself and CNB/CNC and act in good faith and with due diligence (at [181]). The Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine if CNA owed and breached fiduciary duties and/or the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record because there was a close connection to the SLA and the ICC Clause ought to be interpreted widely (at [196]). CNA breached its fiduciary duties and its duty to consult (at [215][218] and [230][232]). Thus, CNB / CNC were not bound by CNA's renewal of the SLA and the 2017 Extension Agreement was voidable (at [239]).\n(b)The scope of the SLA covered only the PC-client version of the game [X2], and CND and CNE had breached the SLA (at [355]).\n(c)CNA had procured, induced or assisted CND and CNE in their breaches of the SLA by unilaterally issuing the authorisation letters in 2016 and 2017, and colluding with them with respect to the execution of the 2017 Extension Agreement (at [551][564]).\n(d)CNA, CND and CNE were also found liable for unlawfully conspiring to injure CNB / CNC by amending the dispute resolution and governing law clause via the 2017 Extension Agreement (at [565][596]).\n63On 18 December 2020, CNA filed HC/OS 1293/2020 (later SIC/OS 2/2022) (\"OS 2\").[41] It sets out its application to set aside the First Partial Award in its entirety pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(i) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (\"the Model Law\"). In the alternative, CNA sought the setting aside of parts of the First Partial Award relating to its breach of duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record and declarations and/or orders made in favour of CNB.\n64On 30 September 2021, CNA filed HC/OS 991/2021 (later SIC/OS 5/2022) (\"OS 5\").[42] It sought to set aside the Second Partial Award in its entirety pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(i) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. In the alternative, CNA prayed for parts of the Second Partial Award that related to the findings and/or orders on the costs of the liability phase and orders made in favour of CNB to be set aside.\n65On 23 December 2020, CND and CNE filed HC/OS 1306/2020 (later SIC/OS 3/2022) (\"OS 3\").[43] They applied to wholly set aside the First Partial Award pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(i) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. In the alternative, they also sought to set aside parts of the First Partial Award that relate to the Tribunal's findings and orders made concerning the claims and reliefs sought by the CNB and CNC in their Notice of Additional Claims and Amendment to the Relief sought dated 3 January 2018. Further and/or in the alternative, they applied pursuant to Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law to set aside the parts of the First Partial Award that relate to CNA's fiduciary duties, CNA's duty to consult, the Tribunal's finding that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2] and the Tribunals' finding that CND and CNE breached the SLA by wrongfully facilitating or authorising third parties to develop mobile games based on the game [X2].\n66On 30 September 2021, CND and CNE filed HC/OS 985/2021 (later SIC/OS 4/2022) (\"OS 4\").[44] CND and CNE applied to set aside the Second Partial Award in its entirety pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(i) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. In the alternative, they applied under Art 34(2)(a)(i) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law to set aside the parts of the Second Partial Award relating to the costs of the liability phase, the costs of the interim relief applications, and the order of simple interest set at 5.33% per annum.\n(b)The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make orders and/or declarations in favour of CNB. To the extent that paragraphs 598(1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (9), and (10) of the First Partial Award refer to declarations and/or orders in favour of CNB, these paragraphs should be set aside. Given that the Tribunal found that CNB successfully transferred the rights and obligations under the SLA to CNC, it consequently had no jurisdiction to make orders and/or declarations in favour of both CNB and CNC.\n(c)If the court is minded to partially set aside the First Partial Award to the extent that it refers to findings on whether CNA had breached its duty to consult and/or declarations and/or orders in favour of CNB, then all other parts which were relied on and/or which were necessary for the Tribunal to make the findings in [(a)] and [(b)] should likewise be set aside.\n70As for the Second Partial Award, if the First Partial Award is set aside partially or in its entirety, CNA submits that the Second Partial Award, as a costs award that is inextricably linked to the fully or partially invalid substantive award, should be correspondingly set aside either entirely or partially, to an extent that corresponds with the First Partial Award.[47]\n71CND and CNE seek to set aside the entirety of the First Partial Award on the same jurisdictional basis as CNA (see [67] above).[48]\n72In the alternative, they seek to set aside parts of the First Partial Award, on the following grounds:[49]\n(a)The Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the claims that CNB added in to the Present Arbitration after the conclusion of the 2017 Extension Agreement (and the SHIAC Clause). Such claims were in the Notice of Additional Claims and Amendment to the Relief Sought filed by CNB / CNC on 3 January 2018.\n(b)The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine whether CNA had breached the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record. This dispute related to the terms of an agreement distinct from the SLA and did not arise under the SLA, and so would not fall under the ICC Clause.\n(c)The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the finding that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2]. This finding concerned a matter that had been disputed and subsequently settled in the PRC courts, meaning that there was no longer any dispute as to whether the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2], and in any event that matter would be governed by the separate settlement agreement.\n(d)The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the allegations against CND and CNE relating to mobile games (as opposed to other formats such as PC-client or web games). Those were disputes arising out of or relating to separate licensing agreements that were specific to mobile games and contained their own arbitration clause.\n73As for the Second Partial Award, if the First Partial Award is set aside in its entirety, CND and CNE submit that it follows that the Second Partial Award be set aside in its entirety. In the event the First Partial Award is partially set aside, then similarly the Second Partial Award should be set aside in part because an award based on illegitimate considerations is flawed and cannot in fairness stand.[50]\n75Moreover, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make orders and/or declarations in favour of CNB even after the spin-off to CNC - the manner in which the First Partial Award was phrased ensured that at least one of the entities would be standing as the correct claimant in the Present Arbitration and parties understand the reference to \"Claimants\" to mean CNC.[53]\n76CNB and CNC submit that there is no basis to partially set aside the First Partial Award.[54] In respect of the argument that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the claims filed after the 2017 Extension Agreement was concluded, CNB and CNC contend that this is circular reasoning. The more fundamental question, in their opinion, is whether the Tribunal's jurisdiction could be ousted by the 2017 Extension Agreement after the Present Arbitration had commenced. As for whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the allegations that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2], CNB and CNC argue that the settlement agreement in the PRC Courts in 2007 did not have the effect of preventing this determination and that this finding was made because of CND and CNE's defence that the games CNB / CNC sought to assert its IP rights over were based on the game [Y]. The rebuttal to the allegation that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to determine issues relating to mobile games is that the SLA contained an implied term that CND and CNE would not exceed the scope of their licence, which is the game [X2] PC-client game.[55]\n79It was not disputed that the standard of review applicable in the present case is a de novo review.[57] The law is settled that the court will undertake a de novo hearing of the arbitral tribunal's decision on its jurisdiction in an application to set aside an arbitral award on the ground of lack of jurisdiction to hear the dispute: AQZ v ARA [2015] 2 SLR 972 (\"AQZ v ARA\")at [49]; AKN and another v ALC and others [2015] 4 SLR 488 at [112]. With this in mind, we allowed the parties to refer to documents which had not been before the Tribunal but which they had had a proper opportunity to consider in advance of the hearing before us.[58]\n80Under the de novo standard of review, the court is unfettered by any principle limiting its fact-finding abilities: AQZ v ARA at [57]. The tribunal's own view of its jurisdiction has no legal or evidential value before a court that has to determine that question: PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal [2014] 1 SLR 372 at [163]. In other words, the court may have regard to the reasoning and findings of the tribunal if it considers that they are of assistance, but the court is neither bound nor restricted by these findings: BXH v BXI [2020] 3 SLR 1368 (\"BXH v BXI\") at [180].\n82Moreover, the Tribunal observed, at [215] of the First Partial Award, that \"the shifting yet uncertain stance of [CNA] over whether the SLA covers only PC-client game or also web and mobile games\" led to the conclusion that it would be a clear breach of CNA's fiduciary duties to renew the SLA (in the 2017 Extension Agreement) without negotiating to demarcate the scope of the licence.\n83Further, the Tribunal found, at [229] of the First Partial Award, that \"the 2017 Extension Agreement was entered into in haste and secrecy with a view to frustrating [CNB and CNC's] attempt to resolve its dispute ... in the present arbitration. The resulting change in the dispute resolution clause was designed to put jurisdiction in a seat of arbitration and under a governing law in respect of which only [CNB] would not enjoy a home advantage\".\n85We turn next to consider the conduct of the plaintiffs in executing the 2017 Extension Agreement.\n86The Present Arbitration commenced on 18 May 2017. As summarised at [54] above, the plaintiffs in OS 3 and OS 4, ie, CND and CNE, requested an extension of time for the filing of their Answer. Their request was acceded to, with the deadline set at 18 August 2017.\n87In the meantime, the plaintiffs concluded the 2017 Extension Agreement within 6 to 10 hours on 30 June 2017. By an email of 29 June 2017 to CNA, Mr M of CND and CNE urged CNA to \"complete as early as possible the signing of the extension of the [SLA]\".[63] At the time, the existing SLA was due to expire on 28 September 2017. Yet, the process to negotiate and conclude the 2017 Extension Agreement between CNA and CND / CNE was prompted by CNB and CNC's application for an injunction to prohibit the extension of the SLA in the Seoul Central District Court on 27 June 2017. On 30 June 2017, Mr M of CND and CNE sent CNA a draft of the 2017 Extension Agreement that adopted the same structure as the 2008 Extension Agreement.[64] Its features included an extension of the licence term for an additional six years, followed by an automatic extension of two years if there were no disputes between CNA and CND and CNE, and an upfront licensing fee for the extension. CND and CNE proposed US$7m.[65] About an hour after the circulation of the first draft agreement, Mr M of CND and CNE emailed CNA with a draft agreement that included proposed amendments to the governing law and ICC Clause, to change the governing law to PRC law, and provide for arbitration in Shanghai under the SHIAC.[66]\n88On the same day, Mr G of CNA replied to state that the key terms did not deviate materially but requested an explanation for the proposed change to the governing law and arbitration clause.[67] In reply, Mr M of CND and CNE explained that given that the scope of the licensing agreement covered PRC and Hong Kong, the changes would \"facilitate a better understanding and application of the law by all parties as well as ... reduc[e] ... all parties' communication and dispute resolution costs, to more conveniently protect the fundamental interest of [the game [X2]] game users\".[68]\n89Subsequently, Ms H of CNA responded with a counter-proposal, indicating that while it was prepared to accept the changes to the governing law and arbitration clause on account of the SLA being performed in the PRC, its agreement was conditional on an increase in the licence fee to US$14m.[69] In reply, Mr M of CND and CNE expressed concern about the counter-proposed 100% increase in the licensing fee compared to the licence fee under the 2008 Extension Agreement, but asked for time for their company to discuss it.[70] CND and CNE later informed CNA that they were willing to increase the licensing fee to US$9m. CNA responded with a final counter-proposal that the licensing fees be fixed at US$11m,[71] which CND and CNE accepted.[72]\n90The plaintiffs exchanged executed versions of the 2017 Extension Agreement at around 8.49pm and 9pm (Shanghai time, GMT +8) that same day.[73]\n91After the executed versions were exchanged, by e-mail timed at 9.44pm (Shanghai time, GMT +8), CNA informed CNB / CNC that it had finalised the extension terms of the SLA and finished negotiating the extension with CND and CNE, with a new licence fee of US$11m and a change in the governing law from Singapore law to PRC law and the arbitral institution from ICC to SHIAC.[74] It took the position that CNB / CNC's unequivocal refusal to renew the SLA meant that it was \"meaningless\" to consult with CNB further on the extension terms.\n92Subsequently, the SHIAC Arbitration was commenced by CND against CNA on 22 August 2017 for a declaration that the 2017 Extension Agreement was valid (see [55] above). CNB and CNC were not parties to this arbitration.\n93CNA takes the position that its conduct was legitimate as it took steps to verify CNB / CNC's claims and review the explanation provided by CND and CNE. It also considered that it could not justify the termination of this lucrative licensing arrangement when it would be \"extremely difficult, if not impossible\" to find a replacement and when it would face a serious risk of an \"unfriendly migration\" which would put the game [X2] out of commission for a period of time.[75] CND and CNE, on the other hand, take the position that they were under the impression that CNA had the authority to conduct the renewal on behalf of itself and CNB / CNC.[76] In contradistinction, the defendants allude to there being impropriety in the manner in which CNA renewed the SLA - in breach of its fiduciary duties and its duty to consult the defendants.\n(a)CND and CNE requested the change in the arbitration agreement during the extension it had obtained to file its Answer so that it could include that change in its Answer as the basis for objecting to jurisdiction.\n(b)CNA agreed to this request not because of any objective assessment that SHIAC arbitration in the PRC was preferable to ICC arbitration in Singapore but because this was what CND and CNE wanted in order to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n(c)CNA was prepared to take into account CND / CNE's interests, rather than only those of the co-licensors. The drawing of this inference is fortified by the fact that CNA was by this time a subsidiary of CNE.\n96CNA used its power to alter CNB's legal relations with CND / CNE to benefit CND / CNE and did so knowing this was against CNB's wishes and for that reason did not consult CNB before agreeing to the alteration. That it requested and obtained a substantial increase in the licensing fees as the price of this change in governing law, seat and arbitral institution shows that CNA understood that the change was no mere formality but something that CND / CNE very much desired and wanted urgently. It is also a reasonable inference to draw on a balance of probabilities that CNA understood that the detriment of this change would fall on CNB, which was in dispute with CND / CNE, rather than itself, as its conduct thus far showed that it had no appetite for a dispute with CND / CNE over alleged breaches of the SLA and because, by this time, CNE was the (indirect) owner of 51.06% of the shares in CNA.[77]\n97The question is whether it was entitled to use its power in this way, which depends on the source of that power and the law by which it was governed. There is also a prior issue whether that question was one for the Tribunal or for a tribunal appointed pursuant to the 2017 Extension Agreement. The argument for the latter is based on the doctrine of separability and it is to that doctrine that we now turn.\n99In this connection, CNA argues that it is not sufficient to show that it breached its fiduciary duties owed to CNB / CNC in entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement. Rather, the primary issue is whether CNA breached any such duties in executing the SHIAC Clause specifically. The argument that CNA acted in breach of its fiduciary duties to CNB / CNC must consequently be proven by facts specific to the SHIAC Clause, rather than facts as against the 2017 Extension Agreement as a whole.[79]\n100On this basis, CNA submits as follows:\n(a)it had not been in breach of its fiduciary duties in entering into the SHIAC Clause because it was motivated by the reduction of dispute resolution costs, which was in the joint interests of CNA and CNB / CNC;[80]\n(b)it did not cause CNB / CNC to suffer any juridical disadvantage that was against their joint interests because choosing PRC law and SHIAC is no less valid than choosing Singapore law and ICC;[81]\n(c)it acceded to the SHIAC Clause because of the increase in the licence fees payable (which was of benefit to their joint interests);[82] and\n(d)the circumstances surrounding CNA's entry into the SHIAC Clause afford no basis for suggesting that it was not acting in the joint interests of CNA and CNB / CNC.[83]\n101A distinct contention CND and CNE make is that by reason of the principle of separability, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in any event to determine the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement.[84] CNB's allegation that the 2017 Extension Agreement was invalid must be heard by a tribunal appointed under its dispute resolution clause, namely by the SHIAC. Flowing from the principle of separability, CND and CNE contend that unless the arbitration agreement itself is independently void or invalid, the parties will be presumed to have intended the question of whether there was a concluded main agreement to be decided by arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained therein.[85]\n102The plaintiffs rely on the English House of Lords decision, Fiona Trust & Holding Corporation and others v Privalov and others[2007] 4 All ER 951 (\"Fiona Trust\"), which was cited in BXH v BXI by the High Court in Singapore at [82]. In Fiona Trust, Lord Hoffmann explained that the arbitration agreement must be treated as a \"distinct agreement\" which is void or voidable only on grounds which relate directly to the arbitration agreement, and if the allegation is that the agent exceeded his authority by entering into a main agreement in terms which were not authorised or for improper reasons, that is not necessarily an attack on the arbitration agreement - rather, it must be shown that irrespective of the terms in the main agreement or the reasons for which the agent concluded it, he would have no authority to enter into an arbitration agreement (at [17][19]).\n103The defendants on the other hand argue that the entirety of the 2017 Extension Agreement, including the SHIAC Clause, is invalid. CNA breached its fiduciary duties in agreeing to the SHIAC Clause. The defendants posit that where there is a dispute over whether an agreement or a clause in it has been validly terminated or amended by a variation agreement entered into by one party on behalf of both itself and the other party, the original dispute resolution clause must govern this dispute. Otherwise, the party who purports to vary a contract relying on what it anticipates will be a contested authority will be encouraged to include in the attempted variation agreement a dispute resolution clause that is more favourable to it (regardless of the validity of the variation agreement) in order to displace an existing and valid dispute resolution clause.[86]\n105Moreover, while CNB contends that the entire 2017 Extension Agreement is invalid or voidable, it also proffers separate and distinct reasons to show that the change in the dispute resolution clause was made for CND / CNE's benefit, namely to put an end to the Present Arbitration.\n106This brings the discussion to the more fundamental reason why the doctrine of separability does not have the effect contended for by CND / CNE. This is that the issue before the Tribunal (and before this court) is whether CND / CNE had by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement effectively terminated the mandate of the Tribunal notwithstanding that the Present Arbitration was validly commenced pursuant to the ICC Clause. CND / CNE contended that the Tribunal's mandate had come to an end even though the party who had invoked arbitration pursuant to the ICC Clause (namely CNB) contended otherwise and wanted the arbitration to proceed. It is helpful to reproduce the jurisdictional objection made:[87]\n37. While it was initially agreed to submit all disputes arising under the SLA to arbitration under the ICC Rules, parties have, through the 2017 Extension Agreement, amended the governing law and dispute resolution mechanism of the SLA. ...\n107The basis on which CNB was said to be bound by the 2017 Extension Agreement was identified as follows:[88]\n[CNB] was never a party to the various agreements for extension, assignment and/or amendment of the SLA because [CNB] had entrusted [CNA] to exercise all of [CNB's] rights as co-Licensor including to enter into further agreements with [CND] in respect of the Licence and [the game [X2]] rights. [CNB] is bound by such agreements made by [CNA].\n108Thus, the question for the Tribunal was whether an event that came after what had been a valid reference to arbitration deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction. As Mr Toby Landau KC put it, arbitration \"depends upon there being active consent to the process and that consent can be withdrawn at any time by the relevant parties\".[89] We pause to note that the argument is that:\n(a)Parties' consent was withdrawn by entry into a superseding arbitration agreement; and\n(b)CNA was entitled to effect that withdrawal of consent notwithstanding CNB's objection because of its prior authority to contract on CNB's behalf.\n109Accordingly, the dispute having been validly referred to arbitration with the consent of parties, the Tribunal had to determine for itself whether that consent had been validly withdrawn by what CNA did after that referral and so had to decide for itself whether CNB was bound by CNA's actions. The same task falls to us.\n110We turn to the source of CNA's authority to amend or extend the SLA on behalf of CNB. Parties have taken opposing positions - the plaintiffs assert that the Overseas Agreement first conferred on CNA the authority to execute renewals of the SLA and later this authority arises from the 2004 Settlement Record, while the defendants identify the Entrustment Recitation in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement as the source of CNA's authority to act on behalf of CNB. The answer to the question of which document conferred on CNA its authority to act on behalf of CNB affects the applicable law that determines whether CNA had the authority to execute the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB and consequently, whether it is valid and binding on CNB. If the source of CNA's authority lies in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, Singapore law applies; contrastingly, if the authority was provided by the Overseas Agreement and now the 2004 Settlement Record, then Korean law applies.\n111For their submission that the 2004 Settlement Record confers the authority on CNA to amend or extend the SLA, the plaintiffs make the following points:\n(a)On issue estoppel, the defendants are estopped from relitigating the issue concerning the source of CNA's authority to execute extensions and renewals of the SLA, including the 2017 Extension Agreement. The issue was determined in the 2003 ICC Arbitration, which CNA and CNB were parties to, by the 2005 Interim Award.[90]\n(b)On the issue of res judicata, the Tribunal held that it was an objection as to the admissibility of evidence going towards CNB's claims, rather than an issue of jurisdiction (2005 Interim Award at [193][194]).[91] CNA argues that the Tribunal was incorrect because an objection based on the doctrine of res judicata can still constitute a jurisdictional objection in the appropriate circumstances.[92]\n(c)In response to the defendants' point that there is no identity of subject matter because the issues of whether CNA owed CNB any fiduciary duties, the scope of such duties and whether they were breached were not raised in the 2003 ICC Arbitration, CNA argues that issue estoppel applies to the issue preceding these issues - which is the main question on which agreements and law governed the relationship between CNA and CNB inter se.[93] In its view, that question precedes the inquiry on fiduciary duties and had been raised and determined in the 2005 Interim Award.[94]\n(d)Korean Agreements form the source of CNA's authority. Even if this court does not find that the defendants are estopped from relitigating the issue concerning the source of CNA's authority to renew and vary the SLA, CNA submits its authority originates from the Overseas Agreement and is now contained in the 2004 Settlement Record.[95]\n(e)Based on CNA's Korean law expert, Professor Park Jun Seok (\"Professor Park\"), the Basic Agreement shows that CNA and CNB held an \"intention of a joint creation\" as \"co-develop[ers]\" of the game [X] series.[96]\n(f)The Domestic Agreement thereafter confirms the nature of the relationship between CNA and CNB as being one of joint authorship (Art 9).\n(g)The Overseas Agreement allocated primarily the development of games to CNB and the development of any business overseas to CNA. Although joint copyright owners cannot exercise economic rights to a joint work without the unanimous agreement to do so under Art 48 of the Copyright Act (Korea), the requirement may be waived. CNA submits that this waiver was done by CNB by virtue of an entrustment created by the Overseas Agreement.[97] In this regard, CNA relies on inter alia the use of Korean terms \"daehaeng\" and \"panmae-daehaeng\" to support the existence of this entrustment. This is where the disputed translations from CNA are said to be relevant.[98]\n(h)The Entrustment Recitation in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement did not vary or create a source of entrustment because it was incapable of doing so as a preamble and parties did not intend it to create further rights and obligations between CNB / CNC and CNA.[99]\n(i)On or around the expiry of the Overseas Agreement, the 2004 Settlement Record restated and/or modified the terms of the entrustment.[100] Clause 7(A) in particular vests the right to renew the existing agreements with CND and a Third Party in CNA and required that CNA and CNB \"consult with each other when renewing any of such agreements\". CNA argues that the defendants have acknowledged the 2004 Settlement Record as being the source of CNA's right to renew the SLA.[101]\n112In reply, the defendants refute the plaintiffs' position that there is an implicit entrustment in the Overseas Agreement. On a proper understanding of the Korean text of the Overseas Agreement, the translation \"commission for sales entrustment\" was not an accurate translation. Consequently, the translations provided by CNA in the present proceedings should be disregarded as inaccurate and belated. In the context of the history of agreements, the entrustment of CNB's rights as co-licensor in the SLA only arose in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. Further, assuming that there were any entrustment under the Overseas Agreement, this would have been superseded by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.[102] Neither did the 2004 Settlement Record, nor the 2009 Supplementary Agreement, restate, modify and/or revive the expired Overseas Agreement.[103] Further, the defendants emphasise that the plaintiffs themselves took the position that the source of CNA's authority to extend and/or amend the SLA is the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.[104]\n113The defendants seek to convince this court that the contractual source of CNA's authority is the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. To this end, CNB and CNC raise the following arguments:[105]\n(a)Based on the text and commercial purpose of the agreements and the parties' conduct, CNA's authority originates from the Entrustment Recitation in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement. In the recital of the 2017 Extension Agreement, the 2002 Supplementary Agreement was expressly referred to as the agreement which \"amended the [SLA] to add [CNB] as a co-Licensor ... of [the game [X2]] and [CNB] irrevocably entrusted [CNA] to exercise all rights as a co-licensor on behalf of [CNB]\".[106]\n(b)In the subsequent agreements between CNA and CND / CNE to extend and/or amend the SLA (such as the 2005 Extension Agreement, the 2008 Extension Agreement, and the 2017 Extension Agreement), the parties cited the 2002 Supplementary Agreement for CNA's authority and not the Overseas Agreement.\n(c)Finally, parties could not have intended for the entrustment to take place in the Overseas Agreement, as it was revocable and expired on 31 December 2004. In contrast, the 2002 Supplementary Agreement concerned an \"irrevocable entrustment\".\n114It is well-established that the requirements of issue estoppel are as follows (see Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301 [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 at [14][15]):\n(a)there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits;\n(b)that judgment must be by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n(c)there must be identity of the parties to the two actions that are being compared; and\n(d)there must be an identity of subject matter in the two proceedings.\n115It is well-recognised that arbitration awards can be final and conclusive determinations for the purposes of invoking res judicata: CKR Contract Services Pte Ltd v Asplenium Land Pte Ltd and others [2020] 5 SLR 665 at [62].[107]\n116The finding at [124] of the 2005 Interim Award that CNA relies upon was that:\n[T]he determination of the rights and reliefs sought by [CNB] against [CNA] falls properly within the scope of the Domestic Agreement and the Overseas agreement, and not the tripartite Supplementary Agreement. As such, although [CNA] and [CNB] are parties to the Supplementary Agreement and Clause 8.04 of the SLA is applicable to dispute[s] arising out of the Supplementary Agreement, Clause 8.04 could not be extended to arbitrate issues arising out of ... the Domestic and Overseas Agreements entered into between [CNB] and [CNA] as co-licensors.\n119The law on determining questions of agency is trite. The court adopts the evidential approach of identifying and establishing the existence and terms of any contractual instruments (express or implied) entered into by parties: Tonny Permana v One Tree Capital Management Pte Ltd and another [2021] 5 SLR 477 (\"Tonny Permana\") at [103].\n121At the hearing, it became apparent that there were two sets of translations of the Domestic Agreement and Overseas Agreement that parties were seeking to rely on. We focus on the Overseas Agreement only as the plaintiffs allege it to be the originating source of CNA's authority. First, there is a translation of the Overseas Agreement that is titled \"Agreement on Joint Development of Products and Overseas Dealership\" which was certified on 20 October 2003.[108] This was provided by CND and CNE, and it was used in the 2003 ICC Arbitration and the Present Arbitration. Second, there is a translation titled, \"Agreement on Joint Product Development and Entrustment of Overseas Sales and Operation\" that CNA alleges was used at the 2003 ICC Arbitration for which there is no certified true copy or date of translation.[109] This was found in the firm's archives as they had acted for CNA in the 2003 ICC Arbitration. Mr Andrew Yee, a translator, certified the translation as \"true and accurate\" in his affidavit filed on 18 December 2020.[110]\n122The defendants contend that the belated introduction of the second translation by CNA is motivated by the fact that the translation uses the word \"entrustment\", which comports with the case CNA brings in these proceedings.[111] The first translation uses the word \"dealership\" instead. As the second translation was not adduced by CNA in the Present Arbitration, we must first decide whether to admit it into evidence for the purpose of these proceedings. While we accept CNA's counsel's word that it was found in their firm's archives, we are not able to find on the evidence that this was the translation used in the 2003 ICC Arbitration. There were two translations proffered at the 2003 ICC Arbitration, the first translation and another one (see [19]), but it does not appear that this was the second translation as the title recorded at [121] of the Award is different even though the wording of the translation of Article 11 at [98] is consistent.[112] Thus, while we admit it into evidence as one of two translations, we are not satisfied on the evidence that this was a translation used in the 2003 ICC Arbitration. In any event, the task before us is to determine the true meaning of the Korean text of the Overseas Agreement by reference to the translations and expert evidence before us.\n123We agree with Professor Kwon Young-joon (\"Professor Kwon\") that \"what ultimately matters in determining the legal nature of the overseas agreement is the substance of the contract, as well as the parties intent in validating the contract\".[113] Professor Kwon submitted that the word used in Korean \"daehaeng\" really means doing something for another.[114] This would fit with the translation \"dealership\". In Article 680 of the Korean Civil Law Act, the word that is translated as \"entrustment\" is a different word, namely \"weeim\".[115]\n124CND / CNE's Korean law expert, Professor Keechang Kim (\"Professor Kim\"), also noted that the Korean original of the Overseas Agreement did not contain the language of \"entrustment\".[116] We therefore prefer the language used in the first translation certified on 20 October 2003.\n126Locating the source of CNA's authority requires examining the contractual agreements against the backdrop of the relationship between CNA and CNB as co-owners of the copyright. Based on the submissions on Korean law by the plaintiffs' Korean law experts and the defendant's Korean law expert in these proceedings, we find that the Korean law experts agree, in principle, to the extent of the following:\n(a)Article 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) adopts the unanimous agreement system and requires all joint copyright owners' agreement for exercising the economic rights in a jointly-owned copyright (such as extending a licence to use a jointly-owned copyright to a third party). If any one of the joint owners does not grant such agreement, it is not legally possible for any one of the joint owners to exercise the economic rights in the subject jointly-owned copyright.\n(b)This unanimous agreement system does not require all joint owners to jointly exercise (either directly as a principal or through an agent) the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, whereby all joint owners become parties to a contract exercising such economic rights (such as, for example, becoming co-licensors under a licence agreement with a third party), but it requires each joint owner's consent with respect to any other co-licensor exercising such economic rights.\n(c)Accordingly, under this unanimous agreement system, in order for one of the joint owners to execute a contract exercising the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, it is not necessary or required for the other joint owners to entrust the other joint owner with the authority to execute such contracts on behalf of the other joint owners, but consent to exercising the economic rights in the subject jointly-owned copyright is required to be granted by every joint owner. Conceptually, a mere consent in this sense does not mean, in and of itself, entrustment.\n(d)If all joint owners grant their respective consent, any one of the joint owners is legally able to exercise the economic right in the jointly-owned copyright independently and unilaterally from the other joint owners under the unanimous agreement system.\n(e)In practice, it is possible for all joint owners to enter into a contract agreeing on the terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright, and if such contract is entered into, the terms and conditions of such contract shall supersede Art 48(1). It is legally possible for the joint owners to agree in such a contract that each joint owner gives its consent to exercising the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright subject to the agreed specific terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights.\n127Turning to the Overseas Agreement (as clarified by the later agreement defining the terms therein), based on the submissions before us, we find that the Korean law experts agree at least to the extent that the Overseas Agreement and other related agreements provide for the terms and conditions on how to exercise the economic rights in the jointly-owned copyright over the game [X2]. Further, we find that the intention underlying the Oversees Agreement was that CNA and CNB consented to the other having the right independently to extend licences to third parties in respect of the territory outside of Korea, subject to the terms and conditions in the Overseas Agreement. The text of the Overseas Agreement does not support the interpretation put forth by CNA that it provides for the entrustment of CNA with the authority to execute licence agreements with third parties outside of Korea on behalf of CNB.\n128Following the execution of the Overseas Agreement, CNA granted a licence to CNE and a third party under the SLA, with implicit consent from CNB. Based on our review of the contents of the Overseas Agreement as well as the surrounding context, we noted that (a) the Overseas Agreement does not contain any text indicating that CNB entrusted CNA the authority to execute licensing agreements with third parties; and (b) the licensing agreements executed by either CNA or CNB following the Overseas Agreement were executed unilaterally by CNA or CNB, as the case may be, and independently from the other. It can be reasonably inferred that the implicit consent granted by either CNA or CNB under the Overseas Agreement to the other could not, on its own, elevate the party granting such consent to a contractual party to the licence agreement executed by either CNB or CNA pursuant to the Overseas Agreement. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Overseas Agreement and other related agreements should be interpreted to reflect a mutual consent to either CNA or CNB proceeding separately to grant licences, on its own, outside Korea independently and unilaterally from the other, and where either CNA or CNB had granted consent under the Overseas Agreement, the grantor of the consent is not bound by the licence agreement executed by the grantee.\n129The facts leading up to the execution of the SLA and the subsequent execution of the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreement further reinforce this finding. Under the SLA, CNA owes a contractual obligation to CNE to provide certain technical assistance, such as technical services in connection with installation and maintenance and programming services to correct defects. As it turned out, CNE became aware that CNA was not capable of performing such technical obligations by itself, and requested CNA to resolve this problem. This prompted the introduction of the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreement, where CNB was added as a party to the SLA with such technical obligations owed directly to CNE. The 2002 Supplementary Agreement's recital on this point reads as follows:\n130On its face, the recital indicates that the purpose of the 2002 Supplementary Agreementis twofold, namely, (a) to impose on CNB, as a party to the SLA as amended by the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, the contractual obligation thereunder to provide technical support to CNE, with this obligation being one that is owed directly to CNE; and (b) to effect CNB's entrustment of its rights as co-licensor to CNA. The operative provisions in the body of the 2002 Supplementary Agreementinclude specific clauses concerning the carrying out of the desired technical support by CNB but there is no further mention of entrustment.\n131It is worth recalling that the 2002 Supplementary Agreementis written in the Chinese language. It was drafted by the in-house lawyer of CNE. When approaching the interpretation of an agreement, the formality of the agreement as well as the frame of reference of the draftsman are relevant. In this case, the fact that it was not written in the English language by a common lawyer may be material to answering the question of why the entrustment appeared only in the recital and not in the body of the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.\n132With this in mind, we return to the contentions of the plaintiffs. They contend that as CNA and CNB are Korean parties, they would define their relationship in Korean agreements (later, the 2004 Settlement Record) governed by Korean law. Further, the plaintiffs contend that a recital is not ordinarily to be treated as imposing substantive rights and obligations. As a matter of drafting practice, such substantive rights and obligations should appear in the body of the agreement.\n133The first difficulty with the plaintiffs' contentions is that neither the Korean agreements nor the 2004 Settlement Record contain any language of entrustment of co-licensor's rights. The word \"weeim\" is not used. Whilst the English word \"entrustment\" is used in the second translation of the Domestic and Overseas Agreements, we cannot accept on the evidence that this is a proper translation of the Korean word \"daehaeng\". In context, as we have found in [127] above, the Overseas Agreement concerns parties' mutual consent to the other entering into licensing agreements in respect of overseas markets without binding the other party to perform any obligations in relation to such licensing agreements. Further the 2004 Settlement Record does not purport to alter or extinguish the irrevocable entrustment established by the 2002 Settlement Agreement.\n137The plaintiffs explain this reference in the 2017 Extension Agreement on the basis that it concerns CNA's apparent authority rather than its actual authority. That is an unconvincing and strained explanation. The recital clearly states that it was by the 2002 Supplementary Agreementthat CNB entrusted CNA. A simpler reading is that as of 2017, CNA and CND considered that the tripartite 2002 Supplementary Agreementwas the source of CNA's authority.\n138With all of these considerations in mind, we find that the entrustment of CNB's rights as co-licensor to CNA took place in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, is subject to the ICC Clause, and is governed by Singapore law.\n139The plaintiffs contend that CNA did not owe any fiduciary duties to CNB / CNC under Singapore law. The parties did not have a relationship of trust and confidence that warranted the intervention of equity. It is not appropriate to impose fiduciary duties on the relationship in light of the parties' express intentions to have the 2004 Settlement Record govern their duties inter se.[119]\n140The defendants argue that CNA owed CNB / CNC fiduciary duties because it acted as an agent for CNB. The agency relationship, being an established fiduciary relationship, gives rise to a presumption of fiduciary duties: Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals [2017] 1 SLR 654 (\"Tan Yok Koon\") at [205], [207], [209][210].[120] This presumption is buttressed by the evidence of the relationship between CNB and CNA. The defendants define the fiduciary duties owed by CNA as the obligation to act in the joint interests of CNA and CNB / CNC, the obligation to maximise the revenue of the game [X2]'s intellectual property and the obligation to act in good faith and with due diligence in respect of the first two obligations.[121]\n141Co-owners do not owe fiduciary duties to each other at common law simply by virtue of their co-ownership. Each is free to exploit the co-owned property. However, the relationship between CNA and CNB did not remain merely one of co-ownership. Upon CNB's entrustment of its rights as co-licensor, CNA was empowered on CNB's behalf to alter CNB's legal relationship with CND / CNE by making amendments of or extensions to the SLA. Thus, CNA acquired the power to bind CNB to terms agreed by CNA with CND / CNE concerning CNB's performance of positive obligations, such as the provision of technical support. Such terms included governing law and dispute resolution clauses.\n142Thus, from the 2002 Supplementary Agreement onwards, in respect of amendments of or extensions to the SLA, CNA was CNB's agent. The agency relationship is one of the established categories of fiduciary relationship. However, whether that fiduciary relationship does in fact give rise to fiduciary duties depends on the facts and context of the particular case: Tan Yok Koon at [210]. In the same paragraph, the Court of Appeal suggests but does not definitively conclude that \"there is a presumption that an established fiduciary relationship does give rise to fiduciary duties, which presumption may be rebutted on the facts and context of the particular case.\" [emphasis in original]\n143In this particular case, the facts and context support the conclusion that CNA owed fiduciary duties.\n145As part of acting in their joint interest, CNA was certainly entitled to have its own view on what that joint interest was. This exercise would necessarily entail considering its own commercial interest when deciding on amendments of and extensions to the SLA. However, this is not inconsistent with a fiduciary duty to the joint interest. In this connection it is helpful to refer to the English case of Elton John v Richard Leon James [1991] FSR 397. There, the publisher was assigned the copyright in certain musical works authored by the artist. The publisher had full control over how that copyright was to be exploited, but this was not for its benefit alone but for the joint benefit of publisher and artist. In holding that the publisher was subject to fiduciary duties, the English High Court, at 433434, noted:\n146We therefore reject the contention that CNA's freedom to consult its own interest meant that it bore no fiduciary duty to the joint interest of CNA and CNB. The scope and content of fiduciary duties may vary according to the circumstances of each case. A limited fiduciary duty to another or to a joint interest with another may co-exist with the right to consider and refer to one's own interests as well.\n147The Court of Appeal in Susilawati v American Express Bank Ltd [2009] 2 SLR(R) 737 cited with approval at [41] Mason J's identification of the critical feature of fiduciary relationships in his dissent in the High Court of Australia's decision in Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation and others (1984) 55 ALR 417.Mason J said at 454:\n148Mason J in his dissent noted at 454455 that \"contractual and fiduciary relationships may co-exist between the same parties\", and that \"[t]he fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them.\" Mason J went on to make the point, with which we agree, that while the \"capacity to make decisions and take action in some matters by reference to its own interests is inconsistent with the existence of a general fiduciary relationship ... it does not exclude the existence of a more limited fiduciary relationship\". Mason J further elaborated (at 456):\n150One contention made is that the relationship between CNA and CNB has been defined in the 2004 Settlement Record, governed by Korean law, and that consequently no question of a fiduciary relationship under Singapore law can arise. We do not agree. The example given is that the 2004 Settlement Record imposed a duty on CNA to consult CNB. In equity, a fiduciary's duty is not to consult the other but to act in the other's interest. However, if such a duty to consult is imposed by contract, our view is that this does not necessarily displace the fiduciary duty. It is complementary and not substitutive. Accordingly, we would not agree that the imposition of a duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record displaced CNA's duty of loyalty to their joint interest, which entailed not preferring the interest of CND and CNE, the counterparty to the SLA.\n152In support of this formulation of the equitable duty constraining CNA's exercise of its powers, we have referred to and relied on the discussion in an article cited by CNB, namely Sarah Worthington, \"Fiduciaries Then and Now\" (2021) 80(S1) Cambridge Law Journal s154. In particular, Worthington, after discussing exercises of power by a fiduciary, suggests that:\n153This article was discussed by the Court of Appeal in Tan Teck Kee v Ratan Kumar Rai [2022] 2 SLR 1250at [74][76] in the context of the question of where and when a director may owe concurrent fiduciary duties both to a third party and his principal company. In that case, the fiduciary relationship with the third party did not arise from an established category of fiduciary relationships but was an ad hoc one. At [76], the Court of Appeal made the following observation concerning the objective nature of the analysis:\n... if he acts at all, to act in accordance with the undertaking he is seen to have given not to act in his own interests. This is the legal constraint which addresses the moral hazard of having ... fiduciaries in control of the principal's property or in control of acting for and on behalf of the principal. [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]\nIf it is sufficient that the putative fiduciary is seen to have given such an undertaking, that necessarily requires some degree of objectivity in the analysis.\n154The Court of Appeal then went on at [84][86] to consider and reject the argument advanced on behalf of the putative fiduciary that a director of a company to which he owes fiduciary obligations may not voluntarily undertake a role vis--vis a third party giving rise to fiduciary obligations, because a director owes a duty of single-minded loyalty to his principal company, and thus, had to place the interests of the company above all others including his own.\n155That the Court of Appeal held that the existence of a concurrent fiduciary duty to one person would not in law foreclose the possibility of a fiduciary duty arising concurrently in favour of another supports our holding in this case that CNA could in law (and on the facts did) owe fiduciary duties to the joint interest of CNA and CNB notwithstanding that CNA was entitled to consider its own interests before ultimately making any decision in the joint interest that altered its and CNB's legal relations with CND and CNE.\n156Assuming CNA owed fiduciary duties, the plaintiffs contend that it did not breach them. CNA had complied with its duty to consult, and extending the SLA by way of the 2017 Extension Agreement (including changing the ICC Clause and the governing law) cohered with commercial sense. In short, the plaintiffs' case is that a sensible bargain was struck, or at the minimum, a deal that was not adverse to CNA and CNB / CNC had been made.[122]\n157Conversely, the defendants argue that CNA had breached its fiduciary duties by extending and amending the SLA by way of the 2017 Extension Agreement. They cite the Tribunal's findings of an absence of due diligence in the conclusion of the 2017 Extension Agreement, CNA's failure to clarify the scope of the SLA and the amendments to the arbitral institution and governing law as being strong evidence of a lack of good faith.[123]\n158For the reasons given below, we are of the view that CNA's conduct as found at [94][96] clearly preferred the interest of CND and CNE to the detriment of CNB and hence was a breach of its fiduciary duty of loyalty to the joint interest. CNA did not exercise the power entrusted to it by CNB in good faith or with due diligence. Further we are satisfied that the principle of separability does not apply on the facts of this case as one of the primary breaches of duty by CNA was in executing the SHIAC Clause specifically.\n159CNA does not appear to take a position on whether the breach of fiduciary duties necessarily results in the 2017 Extension Agreement being invalidated. It argues that the Tribunal nonetheless has no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement because the SHIAC Clause superseded the ICC Clause.[124]\n160CND and CNE's position is that even if CNA breached its duties to CNB / CNC in amending and renewing the SLA, that did not invalidate the 2017 Extension Agreement because CND / CNE had no knowledge that CNA owed or breached those duties. The question of whether the 2017 Extension Agreement is not binding on CNB/CNC by reason of CND and CNE being put on notice that CNA exceeded its actual authority is governed by PRC law, because the question of whether a contractual relationship exists between the principal and the third party, including questions of apparent authority and the degree of inquiry imposed upon the third party concerning the extent of the agent's authority, are governed by the law of the putative contract between the principal and the third party, ie, the 2017 Extension Agreement. Even if PRC law is assumed to be the same as Singapore law, CNB remains bound by the 2017 Extension Agreement because of CNA's ostensible authority and the principle of separability means that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement.[125]\n161The defendants refute these arguments by asserting that the extension of the SLA was wrong as a matter of law since CNA failed to act honestly and in the interests of CNB such that CNA is taken to have acted without authority and accordingly the 2017 Extension Agreement cannot bind CNB and CNC. Quite apart from CND / CNE's knowledge being irrelevant, the defendants contend that there was evidence to show that CND / CNE were far from innocent bystanders.[126]\n162We start with the well-established principle that authority to act as agent includes only authority to act honestly in pursuit of the interests of the principal. The pertinent section of Peter Watts and F.M.B. Reynolds, Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency (Thomson Reuters, 22nd Ed, 2021) at paras 3-011 to 3-012 is reproduced below:\nAuthority to act as agent includes only authority to act honestly in pursuit of the interests of the principal.\nComment\nIt is implicit in a conferral of authority that the principal intends the agent to exercise the relevant powers in the interests of the principal. An agent who deliberately or recklessly exercises powers against the interests of the principal must know that the agent acts without the principal's consent, and therefore acts without authority. A clear statement of the principle can be found in Lysaght & Co Ltd v Falk:\n\"Every authority conferred upon an agent, whether express or implied, must be taken to be subject to a condition that the authority is to be exercised honestly and on behalf of the principal. That is a condition precedent to the right of exercising it, and, if that condition is not fulfilled, then there is no authority, and any act purporting to have been done under it, unless in dealing with innocent parties, is void.\"\n... [no] act done by an agent in excess of his actual authority is binding on the principal with respect to persons having notice that in doing the act, the agent is exceeding his authority.\n163In our view, on the facts as found by us,[127] CNA's breach of fiduciary duty in agreeing to CND / CNE's request to change the governing law and arbitral institution was not just known to but instigated by CND / CNE well knowing that this would not be in CNB's best interest as such change in the arbitral institution from ICC to SHIAC would enable CND / CNE to present a jurisdictional defence in their pending Answer in the Present Arbitration. This would make CNB suffer the consequence that the Present Arbitration commenced by it would be dismissed due to the lack of jurisdiction. Hence, CND / CNE are not entitled to rely on CNA's authority to bind CNB pursuant to the entrustment under the 2002 Supplementary Agreement.\n164The plaintiffs challenge the Tribunal's finding on the duty to consult on the basis that it is founded on the 2004 Settlement Record, which is governed by Korean law and beyond the scope of the ICC Clause.[128]\n165The defendants make the argument that, based on the Tribunal's findings, the duty to consult arose as part of CNA's fiduciary duties and the 2004 Settlement Record, but the Tribunal had only ruled on the former basis in finding that CNA had a duty to consult CNB on the extension and/or modification of the SLA.[129]\n167Assuming arguendo that the source of CNA's authority is the 2004 Settlement Record, it is undisputed that Korean law would be applicable.\n168CNA argues that under Korean law, the 2017 Extension Agreement is valid:[130]\n(a)There was no breach of any duties owed to CNB / CNC under Korean law.\n(b)The entrustment in the Overseas Agreement does not impose a duty on CNA to follow CNB's instructions without exception. CNB / CNC's Korean law expert, Professor Kwon, oversimplifies the general duty in Korean law known as \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\"[131] by taking the position that it applies regardless of the character of the entrustment. CNA's expert, Professor Park, explains that the \"good faith standard\" under Art 48 of the Copyright Act (Korea) applies instead of the general duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" under the Civil Act (Korea). Under the \"good faith standard\", the execution of the 2017 Extension Agreement by CNA does not automatically render it in breach of its duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\".\n(c)CNA's duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record does not entail a duty to simply adopt CNB's opinion.\n(d)The 2004 Settlement Record modified the scope of CNA's duty owed to CNB by limiting the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" to the duty to consult. This is contrary to the view taken by CNB / CNC's Korean law expert, Professor Kwon, who contends that the 2004 Settlement Record does not affect the scope of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\"but merely affirms the duty to consult, and CNA would be in breach of its duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\"by acting against CNB / CNC's instructions.\n(e)Even if CNA breached its duties owed to CNB / CNC under Korean law, the 2017 Extension Agreement is not invalidated. Under Korean law, the court will not invalidate a contract unless it finds that an agent has abused its authority or there is a breach of public policy, which are unlikely to be presumed from a mere breach of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\". The finding that CNA's breach of duty did not render the 2017 Extension Agreement null and void had already been made in Seoul Central District Court Decision in Case No 2005 KaHap 3276[132] and Seoul High Court Decision in Case No 2019Na2049565.[133]\n169CND and CNE similarly contend that the 2017 Extension Agreement is valid under Korean law. To buttress this contention, they set out the following arguments:[134]\n(a)The legal relationship between CNA and CNB is similar to a partnership, and the relationship cannot be identified as an entrustment. The Overseas Agreement and/or the 2004 Settlement Record meet the requirements for a partnership agreement under Art 703 and Art 711 of the Civil Code (Korea), which is consistent with the conclusion reached by CND and CNE's Korean law expert, Professor Kim, that the contractual relationship between joint copyright holders is similar to a partnership agreement.[135]\n(b)CNA owes a duty of care (ie, the \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\") to the partnership, not to CNB alone. Under Korean law, a partner owes a duty of care to the partnership itself rather than to the other partners or to any particular partner pursuant to Art 681 of the Civil Code (Korea). The duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" must also be read together with Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea), and under the context of a partnership, CNA is only subject to the \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" duty within the scope of the \"good faith standard\" stipulated under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea).\n(c)CNA fulfilled the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement, because it ensured that the partnership did not suffer lost revenues as well as other damages from terminating the SLA.\n(d)Even if CNA was in breach of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\", the 2017 Extension Agreement is valid. The 2004 Settlement Record does not stipulate the consequences of a breach of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" or the duty to consult. Professor Kim opines that Korean courts will deal with such a breach by considering the parties' motives and circumstances leading to the 2004 Settlement Record, as well as its purpose. Given the parties' mutual understanding that the consent of the other party is not required to renew the existing licence agreements under the 2004 Settlement Record, it is unlikely that a court would find that any breach of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" or the duty to consult would invalidate the renewal of the SLA through the 2017 Extension Agreement.[136]\n170The defendants contend that even under Korean law, the 2017 Extension Agreement is invalid:\n(a)There is no disagreement with CNA that CNB / CNC and CNA are joint authors who have executed an entrustment (or mandate). However, the defendants disagree with CND and CNE's description of CNB and CNA's relationship as akin to that of a partnership. This is incorrect because a partnership is usually established in the form of a joint venture and the relationship between CNA and CNB does not rest on an agreement to \"carry on a joint undertaking by making mutual contribution thereto\" which is the definition of a partnership under Art 703 of the Civil Act (Korea). Rather, from the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, CNB had entrusted CNA with the exercise of its rights as co-licensor under the SLA, which falls within the definition of a mandate. Further, CND / CNE's conclusion on the existence of a partnership is premised on CNB and CNA being joint holders, when in actual fact, they are joint authors.[137]\n(b)Under Korean law, the purpose of interpretation is to confirm the objective meaning of the contract. The defendants maintain that only the 2002 Supplementary Agreement expressly provides for CNA's authority to exercise CNB's rights as co-licensor, which includes the right to renew and amend the SLA. Singapore law should apply. Even if Korean law applies, the preamble is treated as an agreement that is valid and in force regardless of where it is located in the contract.[138]\n(c)Assuming that CNA's rights and duties in exercising its authority to renew and amend the SLA are governed by Korean law, CNA is subject to the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" under Art 681 of the Civil Act (Korea) when exercising its authority to renew and amend the SLA. The \"good faith standard\" under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) does not apply in priority over the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" because the plaintiffs do not take the position that CNB / CNC withheld consent to the 2017 Extension Agreement in breach of Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea).[139]Per Professor Kwon, the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" is more akin to the duty of loyalty (ie, the fiduciary duty) than the duty of care under common law.[140]\n(d)Applying the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\", in light of CND / CNE's persistent breaches of the SLA, at the minimum, CNA did not comply with its duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" to act according to CNB's instructions because it did not seek CNB / CNC's views on the renewal or amendment of the SLA. CNA ought to have abided by CNB / CNC's express and repeated opposition to the 2017 Extension Agreement. It was also not a reasonable business decision.[141]\n(f)The duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record is \"the obligation of mutual cooperation and effort based on good faith\".[143] This requires mutual consultation and good faith communications. CNA was in breach of its duty to consult because it did not respect the intentions of CNB regarding the renewal nor make any effort to sincerely and faithfully reflect such intentions.[144]\n(g)The consequence of CNA's breach of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" and/or the duty to consult is to render the 2017 Extension Agreement invalid on the bases of abuse of agent authority (Art 107 of the Civil Act (Korea)) and/or an act contrary to good morals and other social order (Art 103 of the Civil Act (Korea)).[145]\n171The Korean law concept of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" is the duty imposed on the party entrusted to manage the affairs entrusted to him with the care of a good manager in accordance with the tenor of the mandate, under Art 681 of the Civil Act (Korea).[146] Where parties differ is the scope and extent of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" and the interaction of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" and Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea). CNA takes the position that the person entrusted may ignore the instructions of the person who entrusts that are against the interests of the person entrusted if disobeying the instructions is not fundamentally against the nature of the mandate. Further, CNA posits that the scope of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" does not include a common law duty of loyalty and it applies only to the extent that it is consistent with Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) (ie, on the \"good faith standard\"). As for CND and CNE, their interpretation of the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" is that it is a duty owed by each partner to the partnership itself, and further that the duty not to prevent an agreement or refuse consent in bad faith under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) takes precedence over the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\". On CNB's interpretation of the \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\", however, the duty of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" outweighs the duty under Art 48(1) of the Copyright Act (Korea) not to prevent the unanimous agreement between joint authors from being reached or refuse to consent in bad faith. The irreducible minimum of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\", as agreed upon by parties, is therefore a duty to act in good faith towards the partnership.\n172In our view, the key question under Korean law is the nature and content of the duty to consult contained in the 2004 Settlement Record. As noted at [32(c)] above, the duty to consult took the form of a proviso to the right to renew. Helpfully, it was considered by the Korean court in 2005.[147] The Korean court formulated it as the \"obligation of mutual cooperation and effort based on good faith\". Further, we would agree with the Tribunal's adoption[148] of the gloss offered by Professor Kwon to the Tribunal, namely that \"such consultation between the parties means genuine consultation between the parties based on the spirit of the principle of good faith, and does not mean a virtually unilateral notification or a cursory consultation between the parties only which is intended to create the appearance of consultation.\"\n173CNA accepted at the oral hearing that it did not consult CNB concerning the change of governing law, seat and arbitral institution.[149] Its key point is that consultation was pointless because CNB was adamant that it did not want to renew the SLA. There are two answers to this. The first is that CNB's objections concerned clarity of scope (which would impact pricing) and the lack of engagement on the issue of alleged past breaches by CND / CNE. Both of these objections appear to have been genuinely held, and a meaningful process of consultation could have potentially resolved them. The second is that, like the Tribunal,[150] we infer that CNA's decision not to consult meaningfully was part of a concerted effort in the interests of CND / CNE to frustrate CNB and CNC's reference in the Present Arbitration, \"designed to put jurisdiction in a seat of arbitration and under a governing law in respect of which only [CNB] would not enjoy a home advantage\".\n174Turning to the consequences of a breach of the duty to consult, we accept that such a breach could amount to an abuse of authority under Art 107 of the Civil Act (Korea). If, in so acting in breach of its duty, the agent acted by compromising the principal's interests in favour of his own or a third party's or subordinated the principal's interests either to its own or third party's interest, and if the counterparty knew or could have known of such abuse of authority by the agent, then the principal would not be held liable for such action of the agent, and, accordingly, the agreement so executed by the agent would be deemed void between the principal and the counterparty.\n175In this case, we would find that when CNA negotiated and executed the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB, CNA failed to consult CNB at all concerning the changes to governing law, seat and arbitral institution, and did not properly or genuinely consult CNB on the extension in general. In fact, it went along with CND's / CNE's desire to execute the extension quickly so that it could be raised in the latter's Answer in the Present Arbitration. This was a breach of \"Seonkwan Ei-mu\" and based on our objective review of the facts and relevant circumstances presented to us, we find that CNA acted with an intent of breaching its duty in executing the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB, whereby it abused its authority in such manner as would compromise CNB's interest in favour of the counterparty, CND / CNE, and subordinate CNB's interests to those of CND / CNE. It is also clear that CND / CNE instigated this breach of duty in full knowledge that this would be a breach of CNA's duty. In particular, with respect to the change in the arbitration institution as suggested by CND / CNE and included in the 2017 Extension Agreement, CND / CNE knew or ought to have recognised that CNA's act of agreeing thereto (and executing the 2017 Extension Agreement on behalf of CNB) went against CNB's interests, for the benefit of CND / CNE. We are of the view that, under the relevant Korean law and the Korean Supreme Court precedents included in the submissions to the court,[151] all requirements would be satisfied to make the 2017 Extension Agreement invalid between CNB and CND / CNE by analogy with the proviso of Art 107(1) of the Civil Code (Korea). Consequently, if this issue were not moot, we would have found that by analogy with Art 107 of the Civil Act (Korea), CNB was entitled to avoid the 2017 Extension Agreement.\n176Whether the question was an open one would depend on whether it had been already answered by the Korean Court against CNB. Our reading of the Korean decisions is that they were determined on procedural grounds, rather than the substantive law. Accordingly, there would have been no obstacle to us considering and determining this issue for ourselves.\n178CNA alleges that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to determine the issue of the validity of the SHIAC Clause and the 2017 Extension Agreement. This is because the issue of the validity of the SHIAC Clause and the 2017 Extension Agreement ought to be determined by a SHIAC tribunal constituted pursuant to the SHIAC Clause in the 2017 Extension Agreement, rather than an ICC tribunal constituted pursuant to the ICC Clause in the SLA.[152] Furthermore, the validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement was confirmed in the SHIAC Arbitration.[153]\n179The defendants argue that the SHIAC Clause is invalid as CNA acted in breach of its fiduciary duty and/or duty to consult CNB. They reject the plaintiffs' reliance on the SHIAC Award, which declared that the 2017 Extension Agreement was valid and effective. They argue that the SHIAC Arbitration was a \"sham\" and an \"uncontested charade\" to \"cloak the purported 2017 Extension Agreement with legitimacy\".[154]\n180CNA does not contend that CNB is bound by the SHIAC Award, presumably because they recognise that CNB was not a party to the SHIAC Arbitration.\n182Once the Tribunal held that the Present Arbitration was not terminated, it was entitled to proceed to determine the disputes that had been referred to it in the Present Arbitration. The next question is whether it also had jurisdiction to determine claims added after conclusion of the 2017 Extension Agreement. We now turn to that question.\n183CND and CNE argue that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the claims that CNB and CNC added to the Present Arbitration after the conclusion of the 2017 Extension Agreement. These would be the claims in CNB and CNC's Notice of Additional Claims and Amendment to the Relief Sought filed on 3 January 2018 (the \"Post-2017 Extension Agreement Claims\").[155] The Post-2017 Extension Agreement Claims included requests for the following reliefs:\n(a)a declaration that the licence term under the SLA had expired on 28 September 2017 at the latest and that the SLA ceased to have effect from the same date;\n(b)an order that CND and CNE cease any and all use of the software relating to the game [X2] and return all versions of them;\n(c)an order that CND, CNE and CNA pay damages resulting from their conspiracy to injure CNB / CNC through the unlawful execution of the 2017 Extension Agreement and subsequent commencement of the SHIAC proceedings, with such damages to be assessed; and\n(d)an order that CNA pay damages arising from CNA's dishonest assistance of CND and CNE's breaches of the SLA.\n184CND and CNE's position is that the Post-2017 Extension Agreement Claims involved events after the Present Arbitration commenced, so the disputes would fall under the SHIAC Clause.[156]\n185CNB's rebuttal is that the Post-2017 Extension Agreement Claims were advanced on the ground that the SLA expired on 28 September 2017, because it had not been validly extended.[157] The validity of the extension was in their submission within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. We understand their submission to be that the rest of the relief that was added amounted to consequential relief.\n186We note that CND and CNE have not contended that events after commencement of an arbitration may not form part of the dispute referred to arbitration or found claims or relief within it. It is of course necessary that \"[a]ny new claim or cause of action ... must require ... clear identification and admission by the arbitration tribunal\" and that this \"is particularly so with a claim only allegedly arising after commencement of an arbitration\": perCBX and another v CBZ and others [2022] 1 SLR 47 at [51].\n187The thrust of CND and CNE's argument is not that the events relied on post-date commencement of the arbitration but that any disputes relating to them must fall under the SHIAC Clause. We understand their submission to be that even if the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to consider whether its mandate was terminated by the 2017 Extension Agreement, including whether the extension was obtained in breach of fiduciary duty, it had no jurisdiction to consider new claims because such new claims are governed by the SHIAC Clause. Thus, even though the Tribunal held that the 2017 Extension Agreement was not valid in the course of rejecting the challenge to its mandate and even if the court agreed in its own de novo review that the Tribunal was correct to do so, this did not entitle the Tribunal to then determine on the merits claims that were governed by the SHIAC Clause.\n188We do not accept CND and CNE's argument. In this case, there was an existing relationship between principal, agent and third party which was governed by the ICC Clause. The validity of the 2017 Extension Agreement was challenged on the basis that there was a breach of fiduciary duty that arose from that existing relationship. This distinguishes this case from situations where the only question is under which of two or more valid arbitration clauses a particular dispute arises. As the 2017 Extension Agreement (including the change to the arbitration clause) did not bind CNB, the operative arbitration agreement remained the ICC Clause.\n189CND and CNE submit that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when it determined that CNA breached the duty to consult under the 2004 Settlement Record by entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement. The parties to the SLA did not consent to arbitrate disputes arising under the 2004 Settlement Record under the ICC Clause in the SLA. The Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider a dispute under the 2004 Settlement Record and parties had not submitted such a dispute to the Tribunal. Despite the common understanding between parties on the ambit of the ICC Clause, the Tribunal made findings in the First Partial Award that CNA owed CNB a duty to consult as to the renewal of the SLA.[158]\n190CNB and CNC contend that the dispute arises under the SLA because the remedy sought under the claim is a declaration that the licence term under the SLA had expired.\nIn the Tribunal's view, adopting the Fiona Trust approach ... the renewal or extension of the SLA is a matter that is covered by the arbitration agreement in the SLA. The exercise of the duty to consult was closely connected to the SLA, and the parties, being rational businessmen, should be assumed to have intended the arbitration clause to apply to all disputes in relation to the SLA, including disputes in relation to its renewal or extension.\n192It is important to understand that at this stage of the argument the question is whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction in an arbitration under the SLA to make findings of a breach of the duty to consult arising under the 2004 Settlement Record in relation to the renewal, extension or amendment of the SLA. Once the question is posed in this way, it is clear that the dispute arose under the SLA and hence the Tribunal had jurisdiction.\n193CNA's objection is that, once the Tribunal found at [299] of the First Partial Award that CNB had effectively transferred its rights and obligations under the SLA to CNC, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make orders and declarations in favour of CNB.\n194CNB / CNC's response is that the Tribunal framed its orders generically in favour of the \"Claimants\" and hence the orders can be readily understood as meaning CNC rather than CNB, given the Tribunal's findings.\n195We accept that CNB / CNC's explanation and confirmation of the meaning of the orders resolves CNA's concern.\n196CND and CNE argue that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by making the finding that the game [Y] was derived from the game [X2]. They contend that this finding should be set aside pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law.[160] The defendants, CNB / CNC, say that they made the allegations on which the Tribunal's finding was based only because CND and CNE raised in their defence that certain games (labelled in the arbitration as Table A games) that CNB and CNC claimed were derived from the game [X2] were in fact derived from game [Y], in relation to which there had been a settlement.[161]\n197Thus, it was in issue before the Tribunal whether the Table A games were derived from or were an unlicensed exploitation of the game [X2]. Essentially, the Tribunal rejected CND and CNE's defence on this issue which involved establishing an alternative and legitimate provenance for the Table A games. The Tribunal's rejection of their defence entailed in part this finding of derivation from the game [X2]. Given this, making the finding was within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n198CND and CNE argue that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to decide CNB / CNC's claim that CND and CNE breached the SLA by developing / exploiting mobile versions of the game [X2] and/or authorising / facilitating third parties to do so, as this is a dispute falling under the mobile game licence agreements instead of the SLA.[162]\n199The defendants argue that it is not accurate to suggest that the dispute could only be decided under the mobile game licence agreements and not the SLA since they only granted CND limited rights in respect of two specific mobile versions of the game [X2]. Further, CNB / CNC's claim in relation to the unlawful exploitation of the game [X2] through developing or licensing mobile games was based on CND / CNE's breach of an implied term of the SLA. The Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide that there was such an implied term of the SLA and that it had been breached.[163]\n200We accept the defendants' argument. The claim was indeed based on implication of a term into the SLA. That there might have been alternative claims under one or other of the mobile game licence agreements does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction to determine the claim as brought under the SLA.\n201We have concluded that CNA's authority to bind CNB in relation to CND / CNE was established by and contained in the 2002 Supplementary Agreement, which was entered into as a tripartite agreement precisely because until that agreement, CNB had not been contractually bound to perform positive obligations, such as that of technical support, in connection with the SLA. Their relationship was consequently governed by Singapore law, and, on the facts of this case, CNA owed CNB fiduciary and equitable duties in relation to the exercise of its power to alter CNB's legal relations with CND / CNE.\n202In entering into the 2017 Extension Agreement, CNA acted in haste and secrecy, without resolving important matters such as the scope of the SLA. It did so at CND / CNE's instigation because CND / CNE wanted to rely on the change from the ICC Clause to the SHIAC Clause as a jurisdictional objection in the Present Arbitration.\n203This was a breach of CNA's fiduciary duty and CNB was entitled to and did avoid the 2017 Extension Agreement.\n204Consequently, the ICC Clause remained operative and the Tribunal did not cease to have jurisdiction over the disputes referred to it.\n205We dismiss both applications to set aside the First Partial Award in their entirety. The applications to set aside the Second Partial Award are therefore dismissed as well. We give the following directions for the determination and assessment of costs:\n(a)Within 14 days of the date of this judgment, parties are to file written submissions on costs limited to ten pages each, exclusive of any appendices setting out time spent or disbursements incurred.\n(b)In the 14 days thereafter, parties should seek to agree costs and disbursements.\n(c)If there remains disagreement, parties are to write in for an oral hearing, and are to file supplementary written submissions limited to ten pages each two clear days before such oral hearing, focused on points of disagreement.",

        "text": "1When a company receives a claim on a contract of which it has no record and where its purported signatory has ceased to be its employee, does it waive any jurisdictional objection to the arbitration based on forgery of the arbitration agreement if it unsuccessfully defends the arbitration without alleging forgery? If it contests the claim on its merits with the defence that the contract was entered into by its employee without authority, but without specifically alleging that the arbitration agreement contained in the contract was itself made without authority, can it after the award is given against it raise a jurisdictional challenge that the arbitration agreement was made without authority? These were the principal questions that arose in this challenge to an arbitration award.\n2The claimant in this application seeks to set aside an award of an arbitral tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") dated 8 December 2022 (\"the Award\"), which awarded damages in favour of the defendant. The Tribunal's putative jurisdiction was based upon an alleged arbitration agreement between the Parties contained in a letter dated 26 June 2008 (\"the Guarantee Letter\") within which the claimant had purportedly guaranteed the sums owed to the defendant in another related contract. The claimant had disputed the legal validity of the Guarantee Letter during the arbitration, but the Tribunal was unconvinced by that submission.\n3Upon challenge of that Award before this court, our task is to determine whether the claimant has waived its rights to adduce the following challenges before us - (1) that the defendant had forged the signatures of its former officer, Mr Rajesh Agrawal, on the Guarantee Letter; and (2) in the alternative, if he did sign it, that Mr Agrawal had no authority to bind the claimant to an agreement to arbitrate with the defendant.\n4The claimant seeking to set aside the Award is Reliance Infrastructure Limited (\"Reliance Infrastructure\"), a company incorporated in the Republic of India, and the defendant, Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd (\"Shanghai Electric\"), was incorporated in the People's Republic of China.[1]\n5Both Parties had been involved in a major construction project for an electricity generating power plant in Sasan Village, India (\"the Sasan Project\"),[2] and it is from the Sasan Project that this dispute between the Parties arose.\n6On 24 June 2008, the owner of the Sasan Project, an Indian company known as Sasan Power Limited (\"Sasan Power\"), entered into a contract with an English company, Reliance Infra Projects (UK) Limited (\"Reliance (UK)\"), that is related to Reliance Infrastructure (\"the Sasan Project Contract\"). Under the Sasan Project Contract, Reliance (UK) was to procure for Sasan Power the supply of equipment and services needed for the Sasan Project.[3]\n7On 26 June 2008, Reliance (UK) and Shanghai Electric then entered into a contract that provided for Shanghai Electric to supply the requisite equipment and services for the Sasan Project (\"the Supply Contract\").[4] It was Mr Agrawal, Reliance Infrastructure's Additional VicePresident at the material time,[5] who signed the Supply Contract on behalf of Reliance (UK).[6]\n8Although Reliance (UK)'s board of directors had provided express authorisation for Mr Agrawal to execute the Supply Contract with Shanghai Electric by passing a board resolution to that effect,[7] there is no evidence in the record indicating that that board resolution had ever been furnished to Shanghai Electric as the grounds of Mr Agrawal's authority to do so.[8] The validity of the Supply Contract is not a matter of dispute between the Parties.\n9The final version of the Supply Contract did not contain any 'parent company guarantee' clause,[9] owing to a request from Mr Agrawal to Shanghai Electric on 25 May 2008 seeking the deletion of such a clause.[10]\n10It is undisputed that Mr Agrawal had been involved in the negotiations over the Supply Contract, although the nature of his involvement is disputed. While Reliance Infrastructure characterises his role as a purely facilitative one of coordinating the negotiations between the Parties' senior managements,[11] Shanghai Electric argues instead that he led the negotiations between them and all entities within the wider Reliance Group (including Reliance Infrastructure) in relation to multiple power plant projects they were both involved in, inclusive of the Sasan Project.[12]\n11Unlike with the Supply Contract, the validity of the Guarantee Letter was put in issue in the underlying arbitration, and remains a matter of dispute before us. We summarise here the relevant facts that surrounded the execution - or alleged execution - of the Guarantee Letter between the Parties.\n12On 9 February 2007, Reliance Infrastructure, under its previous name: Reliance Energy Limited,[13] agreed to indemnify Shanghai Electric in relation to claims that the owner of another power plant project in Hisar, India may institute against Shanghai Electric for any matters relating to that project (\"the Hisar Indemnity\").[14]\n13Paragraph 6(b) of the Hisar Indemnity contained an agreement to arbitrate disputes between the Parties,[15] and it was Mr Agrawal who signed the Hisar Indemnity on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure (as Reliance Energy Limited).[16]\n14On 20 May 2008, the Parties entered into a Framework Agreement that established that \"[t]he Purchaser shall provide suitable guarantee letter from its parent company acceptable to the Contractor\".[17]Ex facie, that \"Purchaser\" was defined as referring to Reliance Infra Projects International Limited (\"RIPIL\"), while \"Contractor\" was defined as a reference to Shanghai Electric. At that time, Reliance (UK) was the whollyowned subsidiary of RIPIL while Reliance Infrastructure held 10% of the shareholding of RIPIL (with the remaining shares being held by other Reliance Group entities).[18]\n15While Mr Agrawal did not sign the Framework Agreement for Reliance Infrastructure, he did initial at the bottom of every page thereof.[19] Paragraph 3.7 also contained an agreement to arbitrate disputes between the Parties.[20]\n16On 23 June 2008, another officer of Reliance Infrastructure sent an email to Shanghai Electric, copying Mr Agrawal, with an attached draft of a guarantee letter dated 25 June 2008.[21] Under that draft guarantee, Reliance Infrastructure would have guaranteed the performance of Reliance (UK)'s obligations owed to Shanghai Electric under another contract,[22] which related to a different power plant project in India that was owned by the Damodar Valley Corporation (\"the DVC Draft Guarantee\").[23]\n17Paragraph 10 of the DVC Draft Guarantee contained an agreement to arbitrate disputes between the Parties,[24] but the draft was never executed by the Parties.[25]\n18On 26 June 2008, the Guarantee Letter was allegedly signed by Mr Agrawal on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure at a signing ceremony in Shanghai, China. According to Ms Yu Liwen, who was Shanghai Electric's sales and business development manager at the time,[26] she printed out the Guarantee Letter, delivered it to Mr Agrawal, and then witnessed him sign it.[27]\n19According to Ms Yu, Mr Agrawal attended that ceremony on behalf of the senior management of the Reliance Group,[28] as said to be demonstrated by the contents of Mr Agrawal's speech which he delivered thereat.[29]\n20In the Guarantee Letter, Reliance Infrastructure guaranteed (or is alleged to have guaranteed) the performance of Reliance (UK)'s obligations owed to Shanghai Electric in the Supply Contract.[30] Paragraph 10 contained a putative agreement to submit all disputes between the Parties to arbitration, seated in Singapore, and administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC\").[31]\n21On 4 July 2008, Mr Agrawal sent an email to Shanghai Electric's VicePresident, with an enclosed letter relaying various requests made by the Damodar Valley Corporation and proposing a contractual assignment for Shanghai Electric's acceptance. That letter was signed by Mr Agrawal, who was described therein as an \"Authorized Signatory\" for Reliance Infrastructure.[32]\n22On 26 August 2008, Mr Agrawal sent an email to Shanghai Electric, in which he discussed two other power plant projects in India, viz,the Butibori and Krishnapattnam Projects. In relation to both projects, he wrote, \"RIL Guarantee Letter similar to Sasan would be given for Reliance Infra behalf\".[33]\n23The underlying SIACadministered arbitration arose out of outstanding payments alleged by Shanghai Electric to be owed to it by Reliance (UK), that went unpaid and in alleged breach of the Supply Contract.[34] Shanghai Electric invoked the arbitration agreement in Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter and sought enforcement of Reliance Infrastructure's guarantee of Reliance (UK)'s liabilities under the Supply Contract.[35]\n24In response, Reliance Infrastructure pleaded that the Guarantee Letter was invalid, because it was not aware of its existence,[36] and Mr Agrawal had no authority to execute it.[37] However, Reliance Infrastructure did not expressly put in issue that Mr Agrawal's signature on the Guarantee Letter was a forgery, nor did it expressly plead that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.\n25In opening submissions to the Tribunal on 6 September 2021, Reliance Infrastructure made clear that it was not alleging that the Guarantee Letter was a forgery.[38] Reliance Infrastructure never adduced any witness statements of Mr Agrawal nor any handwriting expert evidence during the arbitration to show that the Guarantee Letter was a forgery.[39]\n26Then, on the last day of oral closing submissions, 21 January 2022, the Tribunal asked Shanghai Electric if the letterhead of Reliance Infrastructure on the original Guarantee Letter was embossed or computergenerated.[40] Shanghai Electric's counsel clarified in an email to the Tribunal dated 30 January 2022 that the original Guarantee Letter, inclusive of the letterhead, had been printed in blackandwhite.[41]\n27In light of that development, Reliance Infrastructure's counsel sent an email to the Tribunal on 4 February 2022 alleging that these fresh facts as to how the Guarantee Letter had been printed meant that it \"would prima facie constitute the making of a 'false instrument'\" and \"appears to be a nullity (as all forgeries are nullities)\".[42]\n28In response to the Tribunal's query as to the \"specific findings\" Parties wished for the Tribunal to make in respect of the Guarantee Letter,[43] Reliance Infrastructure took the position that the newly disclosed facts meant \"[t]hat the provenance of the purported Guarantee Letter ... is in serious question\" and prayed for \"a declaration that the purported Guarantee Letter is invalid and unenforceable\".[44]\n29Reliance Infrastructure's updated Schedule of Issues did put in issue the general question \"[w]hether the purported Guarantee Letter is valid, enforceable and binding\",[45] but it did not expressly put into issue the question whether the signatures on the Guarantee Letter were forgeries, nor did it expressly object to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or the validity of the arbitration agreement.\n30Hence, the Tribunal held that Reliance Infrastructure did not put in issue whether the Guarantee Letter was a forgery and must be taken to have conceded that the Guarantee Letter existed.[46]\n31In contrast, Mr Agrawal's authority to sign the Guarantee Letter was put in issue, and on this point, the Tribunal found that Mr Agrawal had apparent authority to sign the Guarantee Letter on Reliance Infrastructure's behalf.[47]\n32Ultimately, the Tribunal's Award ordered Reliance Infrastructure to pay damages to Shanghai Electric for outstanding payments that were due under the Supply Contract. The Award affirmed some of Reliance Infrastructure's setoffs against the sums owed to Shanghai Electric while disallowing others.[48]\n34By consent of the Parties, we allowed the following five witnesses to be crossexamined before us on 1112 January 2024 (see this Court's order dated 6 October 2023 on SIC/SUM 42/2023) -\n(a)Mr Neeraj Parakh, Reliance Infrastructure's Senior Executive VicePresident, who gave evidence on the claimant's knowledge and its basis for believing the Guarantee Letter to be a forgery;\n(b)Mr Agrawal, who testified that he never signed the Guarantee Letter;\n(c)Ms Yu, who gave evidence that she saw Mr Agrawal sign the Guarantee Letter;\n(d)Mr Manas, who gave his expert opinion that the signatures on the Guarantee Letter were forgeries; and\n(e)Ms Lee Gek Kwee, who gave her expert opinion to the contrary - ie, that those signatures were genuine.\n35There was initially a sealing order preventing the disclosure of Parties' identities in this proceeding (see this Court's order in SIC/ORC 34/2023 dated 16 June 2023), this being the default position for all proceedings under the International Arbitration Act 1994 (\"IAA 1994\") (see s 22(1) of IAA and The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG [2023] 2 SLR 77 (\"Deutsche Telekom (Confidentiality of Arbitration)\") at [16]).\n36However, upon considering the Parties' cases before us, especially Reliance Infrastructure's serious allegations of forgery that it levelled against Shanghai Electric, we considered that a compelling public interest may be said to exist in respect of the Parties' identities. In this Court, Reliance Infrastructure has alleged forgery against Shanghai Electric. If true, this is conduct of a kind that the international business community should know about. Conversely, if allegations of forgery are made without proper basis, those too should be known about. In addition, there has been litigation in India that is publicly known: see the proceedings between Parties before the Delhi High Court (Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd v Reliance Infrastructure Ltd on 19 July 2022, O.M.P. (I) (Comm.) 433 of 2020). It could be said that the confidentiality of the underlying arbitration has already been lost, potentially rendering our sealing order \"an empty exercise to protect confidentiality when there is nothing left to protect\" (see Deutsche Telekom (Confidentiality of Arbitration) at [28]).\n37We expressed our preliminary views to Parties on the second day of the hearing, 12 January 2024, and sought their responses.[51] After consideration, both Parties agreed to this judgment being published unredacted.[52] Accordingly, we lifted our sealing order by consent to this extent (see s 23(3)(a), IAA 1994).\n38Reliance Infrastructure now seeks the setting aside of the Tribunal's Award on the grounds that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction due to the invalidity of the arbitration agreement (Art 34(2)(a)(i), UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (adopted on 21 June 1985) (\"Model Law\")), that the Award was affected by Shanghai Electric's fraud (s 24(a), IAA 1994), and being affected by such fraud, the Award is contrary to the public policy of Singapore (Art 34(2)(b)(ii), Model Law).[53]\n39The factual basis for Reliance Infrastructure's legal grounds to set aside the Award are its allegations that Shanghai Electric forged the Guarantee Letter or that, if his signature was not forged, Mr Agrawal nonetheless lacked authority to execute it.\n40According to Reliance Infrastructure, it has not waived its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, on the grounds of forgery and absence of authority, within the meaning of Art 16(2) of the Model Law. It did not waive its right to allege forgery because it lacked actual knowledge of the facts required to plead its case of forgery. It only learnt from Mr Agrawal that he had never signed the Guarantee Letter in early 2023, after the Award had already been published.[54] Before that point, Reliance Infrastructure could not obtain the cooperation of Mr Agrawal because he was working for its competitor, Adani Group, and he feared that divulging any information would render him in breach of contractual obligations owed to his new employer.[55] After it learnt of the forgery for the first time, it made a timely application to set aside the Award on that ground.\n41Turning to lack of authority, Reliance Infrastructure argues that it did not waive its right to object to jurisdiction on the ground of Mr Agrawal's want of authority, since it did put in issue that Mr Agrawal was never authorised to sign the Guarantee Letter during the arbitration proceeding, and it was not necessary to expressly frame that argument as an objection to jurisdiction since its arguments that Mr Agrawal lacked authority to make the Guarantee Letter were coextensive with its arguments that he lacked authority to make the arbitration agreement which was contained therein.[56]\n42To support its allegation of forgery made before this court and not in the arbitration, Reliance Infrastructure relies on two items of fresh evidence. The first is the testimony of Mr Agrawal that he never signed the Guarantee Letter,[57] which it regards as credible direct evidence of such forgery from a neutral witness.[58]\n43The second item of fresh evidence is the forensic report of its handwriting expert, Mr Manas. His opinion is that the signature was forged. Reliance Infrastructure characterises it as a detailed report employing a thorough methodology, with clear explanations of how Mr Manas arrived at his expert opinion that the disputed signatures on the Guarantee Letter were forgeries, when compared to his admitted signatures on other documents.[59]\n44In addition, Reliance Infrastructure points to other external circumstances to support its claim of forgery, including noncompliance with internal company procedures, noncompliance with regulatory requirements in Indian law, the absence of contemporaneous documentation, the removal of a 'parent company guarantee' clause from the Supply Contract, and the high amount that is at stake in the purported Guarantee Letter.[60]\n45Reliance Infrastructure further submits that Mr Agrawal lacked any authority, be it express, implied, or apparent, to make the Guarantee Letter on its behalf.[61]\n46In its view, Mr Agrawal was never 'held out' as having any authority to bind Reliance Infrastructure, given his junior role as Additional VicePresident and the fact that his involvement in negotiations was limited to the facilitative role of coordinating discussions between the senior management of Parties.[62]\n47Even if Mr Agrawal did play a leading role in the negotiations, Reliance Infrastructure draws a distinction between having the authority to negotiate on behalf of the principal versus having the authority to commit the principal to any binding legal obligation on their behalf.[63]\n48Reliance Infrastructure distinguished other instances when Mr Agrawal did sign agreements with Shanghai Electric. He did so either with the express authorisation of a separate legal entity entirely, such as his signing of the Supply Contract on Reliance (UK)'s behalf,[64] or under entirely different commercial circumstances which did not concern a 'parent company guarantee', such as his signing of the Hisar Indemnity by which Reliance Infrastructure (under its previous name) indemnified Shanghai Electric from claims arising out of a joint deed of undertaking made by Parties in favour of the project owner.[65] Consequently, at no point did it ever represent or 'hold out' that Mr Agrawal had any authority to execute 'parent company guarantees' on its behalf.\n49Shanghai Electric broadly agrees on the applicable legal principles relating to a setting aside application under Singapore law, and under Art 34 of the Model Law and s 24 of the IAA 1994 more particularly. However, it argues that Reliance Infrastructure has waived any right to contest jurisdiction and that in any event its claims of forgery and lack of authority are without merit.\n50First, Reliance Infrastructure has already waived its right to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the grounds of forgery and want of authority, as it had every opportunity to make these objections in the arbitration itself, and having failed to do so, it is deemed to have waived its rights under Art 16(2) of the Model Law.[66]\n51On the point of forgery, Reliance Infrastructure had all the information it needed to form its view that the Guarantee Letter was forged. It asserted to the Tribunal that the Guarantee Letter was a \"false instrument\" in its email of 4 February 2022 and expressed concerns over its authenticity yet never sought a positive finding from the Tribunal that the Guarantee Letter was forged.[67]\n52Moreover, Reliance Infrastructure had all of the documents it needed to procure a forensic report of a handwriting expert to ascertain if the signatures on the Guarantee Letter were genuine or forged, but simply chose not to do so.[68]\n53Likewise, Reliance Infrastructure also waived its right to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the ground of Mr Agrawal's want of authority, since it never mounted any objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction nor sought a ruling from the Tribunal that it had no jurisdiction over their dispute. The principle of separability means that it was insufficient for Reliance Infrastructure to only put in issue the validity of the Guarantee Letter without also putting in issue the validity of the arbitration agreement contained therein.[69]\n54In any event, even if Reliance Infrastructure had not waived its right to mount its jurisdictional objection based on forgery, Shanghai Electric submits that the external circumstances prove that the Guarantee Letter is genuine, based on the entire course of conduct between the Parties before and after its execution, including, among other things, the terms of the Framework Agreement, Mr Agrawal's email on 26 August 2008 which acknowledged the existence of the Guarantee Letter and the eyewitness evidence of Ms Yu.[70]\n55Moreover, the expert evidence of its handwriting expert, Ms Lee, to the effect that Mr Agrawal's initials and signature on the Guarantee Letter are all genuine when compared to his admitted signatures on other documents, should be preferred over the contrary evidence of Reliance Infrastructure's handwriting expert, Mr Manas,[71] which it characterises as biased, partisan, and tailored in service of the conclusion that the signatures were forgeries.[72]\n56Shanghai Electric argues that, under the separability doctrine, Reliance Infrastructure's attacks on the authority of Mr Agrawal must fail since they are not directed at his want of authority to bind Reliance Infrastructure into an agreement to arbitrate specifically, as opposed to guarantees generally.[73]\n57Hence, it argues that the arbitration clauses contained in the Framework Agreement, Hisar Indemnity, and DVC Draft Guarantee, and the involvement of Mr Agrawal's in signing or negotiating such documents, meant that Reliance Infrastructure had 'held out' Mr Agrawal as having the apparent authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on its behalf.[74]\n58Shanghai Electric further contends that Mr Agrawal had apparent authority to bind Reliance Infrastructure and relies on the evidence that supported the Tribunal's finding of apparent authority.[75]\n59We observe that Reliance Infrastructure has asserted three grounds to set aside the Award, viz, want of jurisdiction, fraud, and public policy. The success of these grounds all hinge upon showing that Mr Agrawal's signature on the Guarantee Letter was forged or that he signed without authority.\n60The ground of fraud is not, upon analysis, a distinct ground for setting aside. It is only if Shanghai Electric forged the Guarantee Letter that Shanghai Electric's officer, Ms Yu, adduced false evidence to the Tribunal by testifying that Mr Agrawal signed the Guarantee Letter.\n61The ground that the Award is contrary to the public policy of the lex fori (i.e., Singapore) in turn depends on showing that the Award was procured by fraud, which is contrary to Singaporean public policy.\n62Thus, the premise of Reliance Infrastructure's case remains that the arbitration agreement was invalid either because the Guarantee Letter is the product of forgery or that Mr Agrawal had no authority to execute it.\n63Hence, we proceed to consider the following questions:\n(a)Whether Reliance Infrastructure waived its right to challenge the Award on the grounds of forgery and want of authority; and\n(b)If not, whether Reliance Infrastructure proved that\n(i)the Guarantee Letter was forged; or\n(ii)Mr Agrawal lacked authority to make agreements to arbitrate with Shanghai Electric.\nIssue 1: Whether Reliance Infrastructure is precluded by waiver from raising its grounds to set aside the Award\n64Our starting point is Art 16(2) of the Model Law - having the force of law in Singapore (as the lex loci arbitri) under s 3(1) of the IAA 1994 - which provides that \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence\". If raised later in the arbitral process, then the tribunal must be persuaded that the delay in raising the plea was a \"justified\" one.\n65The fundamental purpose behind Art 16(2) is to require parties to raise objections to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal at the earliest possible time: Hunan Xiangzhong Mining Group Ltd v Oilive Pte Ltd [2022] 5 SLR 239 (\"Hunan Xiangzhong\") at [42]. A party should be treated as having waived its right to raise a jurisdictional objection in a setting aside proceeding if it had made a decision not to raise it during the arbitration when it ought to have done so at that juncture: BAZ v BBA and others and other matters [2020] 5 SLR 266 (\"BAZ v BBA\") at [64] (see also Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd [2019] 2 SLR 131 at [50][51] and [61][62]).\n66However, a party will only be deemed to have waived its rights if the objection was clear to the party and they knew of the objection: BAZ v BBA at [59]. Crucially, the question is whether the party had knowledge of the \"mattersunderlying the jurisdictional objection so that it could have objected in a timely fashion during the arbitration [emphasis added]\" itself: per the Singapore International Commercial Court (\"SICC\") decision in Deutsche Telekom AG v The Republic of India[2023] SGHC(I) 7 (\"Deutsche Telekom v India\") at [165] (affirmed on appeal by our Court of Appeal in The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG[2023] SGCA(I) 10).\n67The SICC also considered whether \"India had good reason for holding back on the three allegations due to lack of evidence and stillongoing investigations [emphasis added]\" and whether its \"failure to raise the three illegality allegations in the Arbitration was justified or excusable [emphasis added]\" (Deutsche Telekom v India at [169] and [171]). Thus, once a party subjectively knows of facts that ground the jurisdictional objection, failure to raise it is only justified or excused for good reason which is a matter for objective evaluation.\n68We consider the state of Reliance Infrastructure's actual knowledge of the facts underlying its right to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, based on the alleged forgery of the Guarantee Letter at two stages. First, when the claim was originally made and it could find no mention or documentation thereof within its internal company records. Secondly, after the hearing when it was told that the original Guarantee Letter was not printed on its original letterhead.\n69First, it is Reliance Infrastructure's own case that it only learnt of the existence of the Guarantee Letter, for the very first time, when Shanghai Electric raised it in its Notice of Dispute, and that it saw a copy of that document - again, for the first time - when Shanghai Electric appended that copy to its Notice of Arbitration. According to Mr Parakh, when Reliance Infrastructure received a copy \"for the first time\" on or around 13 December 2019, it checked its internal records and could find no \"evidence of the existence of the purported Guarantee Letter in its records\".[76] It could not find copies of it, nor any correspondence referring to it, nor any proof that its board ever knew and approved of it nor any recordation of that liability in its financial statements,[77] which, on Reliance Infrastructure's own evidence, were marked departures from its established internal company processes.[78]\n70It is obvious that, when a company receives a claim on a document of which it has no record and that none of its current employees recall, one possible explanation would be that the document was forged. Another is that it was signed without authority.\n71Indeed, Reliance Infrastructure relies upon the absence of records as strong circumstantial evidence that the Guarantee Letter is a forgery. Reliance Infrastructure invoked the fact that \"there is not a single piece of documentary evidence to prove or even suggest that the parties had negotiated, let alone agreed to the terms of the Guarantee Letter. No drafts of the Guarantee Letter were ever exchanged between the parties. There are no contemporaneous records of discussions between the parties regarding the terms of any such guarantee [emphasis in original]\",[79] and describes that \"complete dearth of documentation\" as \"especially astonishing when juxtaposed against\" various pieces of correspondence between Parties on the Supply Contract.[80] They contend that the \"suspicious nature of the circumstances leading up to the alleged execution of the Guarantee Letter is amplified\" by the absence of record, that it \"defies logic\" that there is no \"document trail or drafts of the Guarantee Letter\" in Parties' internal records, and \"it is scarcely believable that there would not be any evidence that the Guarantee Letter was reviewed by the parties' inhouse or external lawyers\".[81]\n72All these matters raised in submissions to argue for the inference that the Guarantee Letter was forged were known to Reliance Infrastructure from the start. Indeed, in its Statement of Defence of 13 August 2020, Reliance Infrastructure asserted back then that it \"has no record of issuing such purported Guarantee Letter to the Claimant [ie,Shanghai Electric]\".[82] Yet, Reliance Infrastructure argues that it had \"no reason ... to suspect\" and \"no basis ... to think\" that the Guarantee Letter was forged.[83]\n73Indeed, when the hearing commenced before the Tribunal the possibility of forgery was sufficiently in the air for Reliance Infrastructure's counsel to disavow it specifically in opening the defence.[84]\n74Reliance Infrastructure contends that it had good reason not to raise any jurisdictional objection because it had contacted Mr Agrawal via his mobile phone and he had in effect declined to say anything, because he felt he was working for a business competitor and should not become involved in a dispute on behalf of his former employer.[85] He was not asked whether he signed the Guarantee Letter and hence he did not then tell them that he had not signed it.[86]\n75In our view, if there was no record of the Guarantee Letter and Mr Agrawal had not told them that he had signed the letter, it was not reasonable for Reliance Infrastructure to assume that he had signed it, albeit without authority. It would have been a basic step to ask him the question directly. This was not done.\n76In short, subjectively knowing that the absence of record meant that the Guarantee Letter might be forged, Reliance Infrastructure did not have good reason for not raising the jurisdictional objection. It could and should have taken steps such as requesting the original Guarantee Letter from Shanghai Electric so that it could engage an expert to analyse the signature.\n77The position became even clearer in early 2022. The Tribunal had asked for a description of the original at the close of the hearing of 21 January 2022. An inaccurate answer was proffered by Shanghai Electric's counsel that was corrected soon after by email dated 30 January 2022. This email explained that the letterhead on the Guarantee Letter had been printed in blackandwhite (with Mr Agrawal's signature appearing in blue ink). In response, Reliance Infrastructure's lawyers sent an email to the Tribunal dated 4 February 2022, arguing that the revelation rendered the Guarantee Letter a \"false instrument\". They said that \"[i]f this was done by Mr Rajesh Agrawal\", it would constitute forgery, and \"[e]ven if Mr Rajesh Agrawal participated in this misadventure, he would be a conspirator\".[87] It added that the Guarantee Letter \"appears to be a nullity (as all forgeries are nullities) ... created by the Claimant [Shanghai Electric] (with or without the connivance of Mr Rajesh Agrawal) [emphasis added]\".[88]\n78Thus, at the time of its email of 4 February 2022, Reliance Infrastructure openly aired the possibility of a forgery. Yet it did not pursue that issue further before the Tribunal. Its own Schedule of Issues, updated on 11 February 2022, did not include as a specific issue whether the Guarantee Letter was a forgery. There was only the general question (in S/N 1) \"[w]hether the purported Guarantee Letter is valid, enforceable and binding upon the Respondent [ie, Reliance Infrastructure]\".[89]\n79Moreover, the Tribunal then asked the Parties to indicate the \"specific findings\" sought on the issue of the Guarantee Letter. Reliance Infrastructure, in its reply dated 18 February 2022, did not seek any finding that Mr Agrawal had not signed the Guarantee Letter. It only alluded to its \"serious concerns\" that \"the provenance of the purported Guarantee Letter ... is in serious question\" and sought \"a declaration that the purported Guarantee Letter is invalid and unenforceable\".[90]\n80The picture that emerges from the emails dated 4 February 2022 and 18 February 2022 is that, by that point in time, Reliance Infrastructure subjectively believed that the Guarantee Letter had been forged. At the hearing before us, it became clear that it consciously chose not to raise a jurisdictional objection because it was content to rest on its defences already run in the proceedings. Such was the oral evidence of Mr Parakh. When asked in crossexamination whether Reliance Infrastructure asked Mr Agrawal if he signed the Guarantee Letter after Reliance Infrastructure \"learnt of the possibility of forgery\", Mr Parakh's reply was \"I don't think that was a requirement because it was so clear during the oral submissions before the honourable tribunal. We were ... very confident that this would come through in the award, whenever the tribunal gives the award. ... It's only the award which came other way [sic]\".[91]\n81In other words, Reliance Infrastructure had made a conscious choice not to pursue its allegation of forgery because it was very confident that, under the circumstances, its other challenges to the validity of the Guarantee Letter would prevail in any event. It only wishes to revive that argument now because the outcome differed from its expectation.\n82Accordingly, Reliance Infrastructure has waived its right to raise forgery as a jurisdictional objection before us.\n83Reliance Infrastructure similarly waived its right to raise its objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, based on Mr Agrawal's alleged want of authority, when it failed to put in issue the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute, on the basis of Mr Agrawal's want of authority to execute an agreement to arbitrate, more specifically, whilst clearly having had actual knowledge of all the relevant facts to mount that objection, at the time of the SIAC arbitral proceedings.\n84That actual knowledge is clear from the fact that Reliance Infrastructure did put in issue, at the outset of the proceedings, the validity of the Guarantee Letter, based on Mr Agrawal's lack of authority to execute that agreement.[92] Yet it did not at any time seek a ruling from the Tribunal that it had no jurisdiction to rule on the Parties' dispute, based on Mr Agrawal's absence of authority to execute an arbitration agreement on its behalf. It now seeks to make before us the latter objection based on substantially the same facts upon which it pleaded the former objection - this it cannot do. Having been \"aware of the matters underlying the jurisdictional objection so that it could have objected in a timely fashion during the arbitration\" (see Deustche Telekom v India at [165]), and failing to do so then, it is precluded by waiver from raising that objection now.\n85Reliance Infrastructure makes several attempts to rebut this argument. First, it suggests that it did put the validity of the arbitration agreement in issue because it put the validity of the Guarantee Letter in issue, within which that agreement is contained.[93] That submission is squarely against the principle of separability as described, for example, in Fiona Trust & Holding Corporation and others v Privalov and others[2007] UKHL 40 (\"Fiona Trust\") at [17][18]. An agreement to arbitrate is a separate contract that survives the destruction or rescission of the underlying contract in which it is contained. The separability doctrine is also found in Art 16(1) of the Model Law, which has the force of law in the lex loci arbitri (see s 3(1), IAA 1994), which provides that \"[a] decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause\".\n86Accordingly, to put in issue that the Guarantee Letter was invalid does not impliedly put in issue that the arbitration agreement was also invalid. This is confirmed by the heads of relief sought in the arbitration itself. Reliance Infrastructure never sought a finding from the Tribunal that it lacked jurisdiction to arbitrate the Parties' dispute. Instead, it sought \"[a] declaration that the purported Guarantee Letter is invalid and not enforceable\", as noted by the Tribunal in its Award at [130(a)].[94]\n87When considered against the fact that Reliance Infrastructure never put in issue the invalidity of the arbitration agreement based on Mr Agrawal's want of authority, this declaratory relief can only be construed as substantive relief rather than an objection to jurisdiction. It sought the dismissal of Shanghai Electric's claims on the basis that it was not bound by the substantive contractual obligations found in the Guarantee Letter. It did not attack the validity of the arbitration agreement or the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n88Secondly, Reliance Infrastructure argues that if the main contract fails on a set of facts which would of themselves also entail the failure of any arbitration agreement therein, there is no requirement that a party expressly state that it is attacking both the main contract and the arbitration agreement to put both of those challenges in issue.[95]\n89It relies on portions of the reasoning of both the English House of Lords in Fiona Trust and our Court of Appeal in Founder Group (Hong Kong) Ltd (in liquidation) v Singapore JHC Co Pte Ltd [2023] SGCA 40 (\"Founder Group\") in support of this argument.[96]\n90We do not agree with the interpretation of these authorities that Reliance Infrastructure propounds. Reliance Infrastructure relies on the paragraph in Founder Group at [58], where it was explained that:\nThe principle of separability cannot guarantee the survival of the arbitration clause in all circumstances. Instead, where a challenge to the validity of the underlying contract is raised, it will be crucial to determine if this is also an attack on the arbitration agreement. This will necessarily be a factsensitive exercise, and much will depend on the nature of the challenge mounted against the underlying contract. ... if the allegation is that the entire contract was entered into without authority, this may well be an attack on both the underlying contract and the arbitration agreement, as the implication would be that every clause in the contract including the arbitration agreement was entered into without authority. On the other hand, where the challenge is that the underlying contract is void or voidable for misrepresentation, the arbitration agreement may survive because the parties' intention to arbitrate may not be affected by the misrepresentation. ...\n[emphasis in original]\n91Indeed, that the whole agreement was entered into without authority \"may well be an attack\" on the arbitration agreement, but it may not always be. The distinction is important on the facts of this case. Mr Agrawal had previously signed an indemnity on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure in favour of Shanghai Electric: Reliance Infrastructure distinguished this on the basis that it was an indemnity and not a parent company guarantee. But both contained arbitration agreements. This illustrates the point that the person signing an agreement may have authority to enter into arbitration agreements but not to enter into the contract which contains it.\n92Thus, an attack on the main contract remains conceptually separate, in law, from an attack on the arbitration agreement within it. The learned Lord Hoffmann gave the example in Fiona Trust at [17] that \"if the main agreement and the arbitration agreement are contained in the same document and one of the parties claims that he never agreed to anything in the document and that his signature was forged, that will be an attack on the validity of the arbitration agreement. But the ground of attack is not that the main agreement was invalid. It is that the signature to the arbitration agreement, as a 'distinct agreement', was forged. Similarly, if a party alleges that someone who purported to sign as agent on his behalf had no authority whatever to conclude any agreement on his behalf, that is an attack on both the main agreement and the arbitration agreement\".\n93We do not read the decision in Founder Group as erasing the distinction between an attack on an arbitration agreement and an attack on the main contract in which it is found. While there may be an overlap - if not an outright identity, in some cases - of the facts and evidence used to invalidate both agreements, they remain distinct agreements nevertheless. The question to be asked is whether the ground for invalidation being pleaded would affect the arbitration agreement as a separate agreement. Thus, in Fiona Trust at [18], the mere fact that an agent was shown to have exceeded his authority in making the main contract did not automatically mean that he also exceeded his authority in making the arbitration agreement found therein.\n94It is also important to keep in mind that the question we are concerned with is whether Reliance Infrastructure is precluded by waiver from raising the objection now. For the purpose of deciding that issue, the relevant question is whether Reliance Infrastructure did or did not pursue its jurisdictional objection, on the grounds of Mr Agrawal's want of authority to make an arbitration agreement, during the arbitral process itself. It plainly did not do so. Instead, it was content for the question of authority to be decided by the Tribunal.\n95Having failed in its defence of lack of authority on the merits, Reliance Infrastructure cannot now recast its merits defence as a jurisdictional objection for which it seeks de novo review before us.\nIssue 2: Reliance Infrastructure failed to show that the Guarantee Letter was forged\n96As we find that Reliance Infrastructure has waived its rights to challenge the Award on the basis of forgery and want of authority, its application to set aside the Award must be dismissed. We will not delve in detail into the merits of these challenges, given that Reliance Infrastructure is precluded by waiver from raising them before us now. However, even if those challenges had not been waived, we are not persuaded of their merits in any event. We shall now briefly canvass our reasons for coming to that view on the evidence before us.\n97First of all, the objective evidence proved the existence of the executed Guarantee Letter. The most compelling evidence was the email sent by Mr Agrawal to officers of Shanghai Electric on 26 August 2008. In that email, he wrote concerning two other power plant projects in India that for those contemplated projects \"RIL Guarantee Letter similar to Sasan would be given for Reliance Infra behalf\". \"RIL\" is an acronym for Reliance Infrastructure Limited, with \"Reliance Infra\" being an abbreviation of the same.[97]\n98In our view, the language used must refer to a guarantee letter that is already executed and in existence in respect of the Sasan Project. There can only be similarity to something that exists. Moreover, the words are capitalised.\n99Mr Agrawal's testimony was that he could not remember sending the email,[98] which in his witness statement he referred to as \"an email purportedly sent by me\".[99] Notwithstanding that he could not remember it, he gave evidence that he must have meant a \"draft\" and not an executed version.[100] He testified that subsequently it was decided not to give such a guarantee. First, if Mr Agrawal could not remember the email, he could not reliably give evidence of what he meant when sending that email. Secondly, his explanation is unconvincing and does not match the words he in fact used, as described above.\n100The inference to be drawn from the 26 August 2008 email is that, by that point in time, the Guarantee Letter had been executed by Mr Agrawal in favour of Shanghai Electric for the Sasan Project. That inference is only further strengthened upon reference to the Term Sheet of the Framework Agreement concluded between the Parties on 20 May 2008. This contained a provision that \"[t]he Purchaser shall provide suitable guarantee letter from its parent company acceptable to the Contractor with in [sic] one week of signing of contract\".[101] The Purchaser is defined as RIPIL, the sole holding company of Reliance (UK).[102] The Contractor is also defined therein as Shanghai Electric. As for what \"contract\" is being referred to, it must be the Supply Contract concluded between Shanghai Electric and Reliance (UK), since the \"Owner\" is defined in the same section of the Term Sheet as Sasan Power; hence, that \"contract\" must be a contract with Shanghai Electric involving the Sasan Project.\n101The reasonable inference to be drawn from the Framework Agreement is that, on 20 May 2008, there was a common understanding between the Parties that Shanghai Electric would receive a guarantee letter from a parent company of RIPIL in relation to the Sasan Project. This supports the interpretation that the 26 August 2008 email was referring to a Sasan guarantee letter that was in existence, and not one which might or might not be agreed upon in future.\n102Reliance Infrastructure proffers unconvincing alternative explanations for this term in the Framework Agreement's Term Sheet. First, its witness Mr Parakh suggested that Reliance Infrastructure could not be the \"parent company\" referred to in the Framework Agreement since it only held 10% of the shareholding of RIPIL.[103] But this merely puts in question which company in the group should eventually give the guarantee, not that there should be a guarantee from the appropriate entity.\n103On that question of the intended guarantor there is ample material indicating that that was Reliance Infrastructure. First, there is the DVC Draft Guarantee, sent in an email dated 23 June 2008 from an officer of Reliance Infrastructure to the officers of Shanghai Electric (whilst copying Mr Agrawal). Paragraph B of its recitals states that \"RELINFRA [ie,Reliance Infrastructure] has assigned the BTG Contract to Reliance Infra Projects UK Limited ... which is a subsidiary of RELINFRA [emphasis in bold and italics]\".[104] Although that DVC Draft Guarantee may not have been executed in the end, the contents of that draft, which were sent by Reliance Infrastructure to Shanghai Electric, show that, whatever the internal corporate structure of the Reliance Group may have been, as far as Shanghai Electric was aware, the Parties were content to deal with each other on the understanding that Reliance (UK) was, for all intents and purposes, in fact a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure. This is reinforced by the Supply Contract, which contains a similar description of Reliance (UK) as \"a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited for the procurement of equipments [sic]& services from outside India for the projects of the group companies of Reliance Infrastructure Limited\" in its recitals.[105]\n104It follows that the \"parent company\" of RIPIL (sole holding company of Reliance (UK)) which was to provide a guarantee letter to Shanghai Electric under the Framework Agreement would have been Reliance Infrastructure. This would make sense as Reliance Infrastructure was also the only member of the Reliance Group that was a party to the Framework Agreement in the first place.\n105However, Reliance Infrastructure also argues that, even if it was agreed in the Framework Agreement that a guarantee letter would be given to Shanghai Electric, that understanding ended when Mr Agrawal sought to amend the Supply Contract to remove a 'parent company guarantee' clause on 25 May 2008,[106]which was acceded to by Shanghai Electric.[107]\n106In our view, that does not follow. The effect of the clause was to include an undertaking to provide the guarantee within a week after the signing of the Supply Contract. The clause was no longer needed once it was agreed that the Guarantee Letter was to be provided, as it later was, at the same time or prior to the signing of the Supply Contract. This is consistent with the words used by Mr Agrawal at the time, namely, \"we request deletion from here\". The \"here\" was the Supply Contract. It was not a change of heart over whether the parent company letter would be given.\n107The fact that the objective documentary and circumstantial evidence support the inference that the Guarantee Letter is genuine provides independent corroboration of Ms Yu's evidence that she saw Mr Agrawal sign the Guarantee Letter at the signing ceremony of 26 June 2008, and for the same reason, it undermines the credibility of Mr Agrawal and his evidence that he did not sign the Guarantee Letter. Separately, we also find Ms Yu's testimony convincing. It was given matteroffactly and clearly. Conversely, we do not find Mr Agrawal's testimony to be reliable.\n108Mr Agrawal's evidence on the 26 August 2008 email was unconvincing. In his witness statement, he first stated that that it was an email purportedly sent by him and that he had no memory of that email at all.[108] He did not offer any explanation of the contents of that email - to the contrary, he claimed to have no memory of the \"context in which this email was sent [emphasis added]\". He added that as he never signed the Guarantee Letter \"there was no reason why I would have referred to any such Guarantee Letter for the Sasan UMPP\". This stands in stark contrast with his oral evidence, under crossexamination, where for the first time he proffered an explanation of the contents of an email that he maintained he still had no memory of,[109] as follows: \"the intent of my mail, if it appears to be that whatever the decision will happen on Sasan, we will follow the same one for Butibori. That was the intent\".[110]\n109That explanation, that a reference to a Sasan guarantee letter meant only a potential guarantee letter that was still being discussed between the Parties at the time, contradicts Mr Agrawal's earlier claim that there was \"no reason\" he would be referring to a Sasan guarantee letter at all in his 26 August 2008 email. It also cannot be squared with his claim that he has no memory of sending that email or the \"context in which\" it was sent. In addition to these difficulties with his testimony, the explanation given cannot be squared with the plain language he used within the email itself. The statement that a guarantee letter \"similar to Sasan would be given [emphasis added]\" is clearly not provisional or conditional on some future event that may or may not materialise, but can only be a reference to a guarantee letter already in existence at that point in time. Indeed, he later said that the \"RIL Guarantee Letter\" was a reference to a draft in existence.[111] As a result of such internal and external difficulties, we find that Mr Agrawal is not a credible witness and we accord little weight to his evidence.\n110In contrast, we find Ms Yu to be a credible witness, as her testimony that Mr Agrawal had signed the Guarantee Letter coheres with the external evidence pointing to the existence of that Guarantee Letter, including the 26 August 2008 email considered together with the Term Sheet of the Framework Agreement. Her explanation for the removal of the 'parent company guarantee' clause from the Supply Contract - that Reliance Infrastructure had already agreed to provide the guarantee letter at the same time as the Supply Contract would be signed, making such a clause unnecessary - was logical and made commercial sense.[112] There was no need to bind Reliance (UK) under the Supply Contract to obtain a 'parent company guarantee' when that very company, Reliance Infrastructure, had already agreed to provide one together with the signing of that Supply Contract.\n111Additionally, the attacks which Reliance Infrastructure level against her credibility strike us as unfair, generally resting on minor immaterial inconsistencies which are readily explained as mere lapses of memory from the long passage of time.\n112For example, much was made of the fact that Ms Yu appeared unsure of where precisely the Guarantee Letter was signed, when she was sure that the Supply Contract was signed in the front of the room as part of the ceremony.[113] The suggestion that this was a conveniently selective loss of memory on her part seems unwarranted to us.[114] It is not unreasonable given the passage of time that Ms Yu may not be able to remember precisely where the Guarantee Letter was signed while remembering that it was, in fact, signed at the relevant time.\n113Moreover, the argument that Ms Yu vacillated in her evidence concerning whether the signing of the Guarantee Letter was part of the signing ceremony or not rested on interpretation of what Ms Yu meant by her evidence that the signing of the Guarantee Letter was part of the ceremony.[115] As Ms Yu explained, \"[a]t the ceremony, he did not go onto the stage to sign the document, but in my view that's still an official signing\".[116] When Ms Yu testified that Mr Agrawal signed the Guarantee Letter at the signing ceremony, as \"part of\" that ceremony,[117] she was not saying - as Reliance Infrastructure interpreted it to mean - that the Guarantee Letter was signed at precisely the same time and location as the Supply Contract, with identical fanfare and formalities for both.[118] It could just as easily mean - as she explained - that the Guarantee Letter was signed on the day ofthe signing ceremony, but not necessarily at exactly the same time as the Supply Contract. Moreover, her explanation for why the Guarantee Letter was signed before the Supply Contract accords with commercial commonsense, viz, that Shanghai Electric would naturally want that protection in hand before it bound itself to a contract with Reliance (UK) without a guarantee from its parent company being in force at that point in time.[119]\n114Accordingly, we accept Ms Yu's evidence and reject that of Mr Agrawal.\n115Finally, we briefly canvass our views on the contrary evidence of the handwriting experts, Mr Manas and Ms Lee, whose reports arrived at competing conclusions as to whether the signatures on the Guarantee Letter were forgeries.\n116The two experts employed differing methodologies for their appraisals. Ms Lee did not detect line quality defects in the disputed signatures when comparing them against Mr Agrawal's admitted signatures under a stereo microscope,[120] and identified similar characteristics in terms of pen pressure, line quality, and stroke fluency between the disputed and admitted signatures.[121] She found no signs of tracing in the disputed signatures when examining them under oblique lighting, including the retouching of strokes, unusual pen lifts, unusual pen pressure or stroke hesitation.[122]\n117In contrast, Dr Manas's methodology involved among other thingssuperimposing the disputed signatures upon the admitted signatures under transmitted light to detect suspicious similarities and indicators of manual tracing,[123] using oblique light to detect indentations as a sign of unusually high pen pressure as indicative of slower execution in a forgery,[124] and the 'ruled square' method of examining the admitted and disputed signatures under a transparent sheet bearing ruled squares of the same scale, to compare them for suspicious similarities.[125] Based on these methods, he concluded that all five initials and signatures on the Guarantee Letter were the product of forgery.\n118We do not accept the criticisms of Mr Manas as an expert pressed by counsel for Shanghai Electric.[126] We consider that he attempted a thorough examination of the material before him. He was not biased or partial. However, we are not able to accept his conclusion that the signature and initials were forged. In our view, Mr Manas's interpretation of the evidence was not sufficiently compelling, especially when Ms Lee's interpretation was considered.\n119For example, Mr Manas detected the presence and absence of striations in several of the disputed signatures, which he chalked up to the deliberate retracing or retouching of strokes, which is indicative of forgery.[127] In contrast, Ms Lee did not interpret these striations as indicative of forgery, and was of the view that they could be attributable to the uneven ink flow of a ballpoint pen.[128]\n120Likewise, Mr Manas detected what he regarded as line quality defects in the disputed signatures, which he interpreted as being indicative of hesitation, slow execution, retracing of strokes, and unnatural pen pauses and pen lifts, all signs of forgery in his view.[129] In contrast, Ms Lee was of the view that they were attributable to striations from a ballpoint pen or an unsteadiness in pen movement also seen in Mr Agrawal's admitted signatures.[130]\n121While Mr Manas had concluded from his superimposition of the signatures under transmitted light that, among other things, the long form signature on the Guarantee Letter had suspicious similarities with one of Mr Agrawal's admitted signatures, suggesting that the latter was used to trace the former,[131] Ms Lee was of the view that the signatures were not suspiciously similar, and there were marked and significant departures in their sizes, formations, and relative alignments.[132]\n122We do not propose to set out exhaustively the differences between the expert opinions of Ms Lee and Mr Manas. It suffices for us to state that we consider these to be attributable to reasonable differences of interpretation by two handwriting experts. They have both drawn broadly logical inferences from the same set of primary data but reach differing secondary conclusions. Hence, for this reason, taking their evidence on its own, we would not prefer the expert conclusions of Mr Manas over Ms Lee. Thus, even on the conflicting expert evidence alone, Reliance Infrastructure would have failed to discharge its burden of proving forgery of the Guarantee Letter.\n123We do not, however, assess the conflicting expert evidence in isolation. We consider that evidence in conjunction with the totality of the direct evidence of Ms Yu and Mr Agrawal together with the circumstantial evidence concerning the execution of the Guarantee Letter. Such circumstantial evidence, as we have explained, strongly supports the inference that the Guarantee Letter is genuine and was signed by Mr Agrawal. Hence, even if Reliance Infrastructure had not waived its forgery claim, we would have rejected it on its merits, based on the totality of the evidence before us.\n124Finally, we find that Mr Agrawal had the apparent authority to commit Reliance Infrastructure into agreements to arbitrate with Shanghai Electric, and would have dismissed its jurisdictional objection on this ground even if it had not been waived.\n125As a preliminary point, we note for completeness that although Reliance Infrastructure had made submissions on Mr Agrawal's absence of express actual authority, implied actual authority, and apparent authority,[133] while Shanghai Electric submitted on Mr Agrawal's implied authority and apparent authority,[134] the central point in issue is Mr Agrawal's apparent authority. If he had apparent authority, the issues of express and implied actual authority are moot.\n126We also note that the Parties' written submissions were at odds as to the governing law to be applied to the agreement to arbitrate in the Guarantee Letter. Reliance Infrastructure's position was that the applicable law was Indian law, and in the alternative, Singapore law,[135] whereas Shanghai Electric's view was that the governing law of the arbitration agreement was English law.[136] By the time of the second day of the hearing before us, 12 January 2024, however, the Parties indicated that they were prepared to agree that the law which governs the formation of the arbitration agreement (based on Mr Agrawal's apparent authority) is English law.[137] This accords with the view of the Tribunal, which held in its Award that the governing law of the arbitration agreement was English law.[138]\n127Hence, we apply English law to determine whether Mr Agrawal had the apparent authority to conclude an arbitration agreement on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure. The locus classicus is the English Court of Appeal decision of Freeman and Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd and another [1964] 2 QB 480 (\"Freeman & Lockyer\"). This held that the most common means by which a principal may represent or 'hold out' that an agent has ostensible authority to contract on its behalf is the conduct of permitting or acquiescing in the agent conducting the business of the principal with third parties, cloaking that agent with apparent authority to make contracts in the ordinary course of such business: Freeman & Lockyer at 505.\n128On that ground, we find that Reliance Infrastructure had 'held out' Mr Agrawal as having the apparent authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on its behalf, for the reasons that follow.\n129In our view, the clearest representation that Mr Agrawal had apparent authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on Reliance Infrastructure's behalf was their having him sign the Hisar Indemnity. This indemnity contained an arbitration agreement in Paragraph 6(b).[139] It was signed by Mr Agrawal on behalf of Reliance Energy Limited, the previousname of Reliance Infrastructure.[140] That agreement had been executed on 9 February 2007, before the signing of the Guarantee Letter on 26 June 2008. Similar to the Guarantee Letter, it concerned a power plant project in India which both Parties were involved in.\n130While there are differences between the arbitral processes provided in Paragraph 6(b) of the Hisar Indemnity and Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter - eg, the former provides for one arbitrator, the latter provides for three; the former selects SIAC arbitration rules as the procedural regime, the latter selects UNCITRAL arbitration rules, etc - these do not affect the salient point that Reliance Infrastructure effectively 'held out' Mr Agrawal as having the authority to commit it into agreements to arbitrate disputes with Shanghai Electric. The differences are minor and immaterial to the question of authority to bind Reliance Infrastructure to arbitration agreements.\n131Reliance Infrastructure invokes differences in the commercial context surrounding the two agreements to argue that Mr Agrawal's authority to execute the Hisar Indemnity did not amount to a representation that he could execute the Guarantee Letter. In particular, it argues that the indemnity in the Hisar Indemnity was for a joint deed of undertaking (JDU) executed by both Parties to the project owner, whereas the Guarantee Letter concerned a 'parent company guarantee', which it says Mr Agrawal had no authority to make.[141]\n132That argument is at odds with the principle that agreements to arbitrate are separate and distinct agreements from the underlying contract. Even if it is assumed that Mr Agrawal's signing of the Hisar Indemnity would not amount to a reasonable representation that he could sign 'parent company guarantees' on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure, it would nonetheless amount to a representation that he could sign arbitration agreements on their behalf. It is not enough to point to commercial differences between the Guarantee Letter's and Hisar Indemnity's substantive terms; instead, \"[i]t would have to be shown that whatever the terms of the main agreement or the reasons for which the agent concluded it, he would have had no authority to enter into an arbitration agreement\": Fiona Trust at [18].\n133Hence, the fact that Reliance Infrastructure permitted or acquiesced in Mr Agrawal signing an arbitration agreement on its behalf within the Hisar Indemnity, thereby committing it to arbitrate its disputes with Shanghai Electric, was a clear representation that he had authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on its behalf. We consider that that representation is even clearer when considered together with two other events -\n(a)First, while he did not sign the agreement itself, on 20 May 2008, Mr Agrawal initialled at the bottomleft of every page of the Framework Agreement on Reliance Infrastructure's behalf, including the page for Paragraph 3.7, which also contained an agreement to arbitrate disputes with Shanghai Electric;[142] and\n(b)On 23 June 2008, Mr Devinder Batta, who is described by Mr Agrawal as his \"junior\",[143] sent an email to Shanghai Electric's officers, copying Mr Agrawal, proposing a draft of the DVC Draft Guarantee to be reviewed and \"finalised in today's meeting\",[144] Paragraph 10 of which contained an agreement to arbitrate disputes with Shanghai Electric.[145] This draft was similarly worded to Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter.\n134We find that a reasonable person placed in Shanghai Electric's shoes, considering the totality of Reliance Infrastructure's conduct, would conclude that Mr Agrawal had authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on Reliance Infrastructure's behalf. Thus, the making of the arbitration agreement found in Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter fell squarely within the scope of Mr Agrawal's ostensible authority. This is regardless of whatever may be said about Mr Agrawal's apparent authority (or lack thereof) to make 'parent company guarantees' or to execute other commercial agreements between the Parties.\n135Indeed, the differences in nature between the Hisar Indemnity and the Guarantee Letter were not so great that his previously signing the Hisar Indemnity on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure would not amount to a representation that he had authority to sign the Guarantee Letter. Both were commercial contracts. An objective observer would not have come to the view that his authority was limited only to indemnities and not to parent company guarantees.\n136In any event, our finding that Mr Agrawal had apparent authority is only reinforced when one broadens the scope of analysis beyond Mr Agrawal's prior making, signing or proposing of arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric to consider the wider pattern of Mr Agrawal's involvement in the negotiations between Parties on various power plant projects they were both involved in.\n137That conduct of Mr Agrawal included -\n(a)Leading the negotiations between the Reliance Group entities and Shanghai Electric, as averred by Reliance Infrastructure's witness, Mr Parakh, who confirmed that while Mr Agrawal was a 'liaison', he also led the negotiations, while not having decisionmaking authority;[146]\n(c)Sending an email to the officers of Shanghai Electric on 30 July 2007 conveying that he and two members of Reliance Group's senior management would like to visit Shanghai Electric's office \"as soon as possible to discuss the frame work and strategy for the Sasan as well as for Shahapur projects\";[148]\n(d)Sending other emails to Shanghai Electric relaying relevant draft contractual documents on 8 October 2007,[149] arranging for discussions to finalise the signing of contracts on 16 February 2008,[150] and relaying comments and changes on the terms of draft contractual documents on 29 February 2008,[151]14 March 2008,[152] and 9 May 2008;[153]\n(e)Initialling at the bottomleft of every page of the Framework Agreement between the Parties on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure on 20 May 2008;[154]\n(f)Proposing contractual changes such as in the email dated 25 May 2008 seeking the deletion of the 'parent company guarantee' clause from the Supply Contract;[155]\n(g)Attending the signing ceremony on 26 June 2008 when members of Reliance Group's senior management could not be present, delivering a speech which conveyed various sentiments \"on behalf of\" the Reliance Group;[156]\n(h)Signing the Supply Contract at the signing ceremony on 26 June 2008 on behalf of Reliance (UK),[157] subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure (as described in the Supply Contract and the DVC Draft Guarantee);[158]\n(i)As we regard Ms Yu to be a credible witness and would prefer her evidence over Mr Agrawal's, we would add to the above list that Mr Agrawal negotiated the terms of the Guarantee Letter with an officer of Shanghai Electric's legal department on 25 June 2008,[159] and was sent by the Reliance Group to sign both the Supply Contract and Guarantee Letter at the signing ceremony on 26 June 2008;[160] and\n(j)Finally, his conduct postdating the Guarantee Letter of 26 June 2008 may bear relevance in corroborating the course of conduct between the Parties prior to that date. Such conduct would include Mr Agrawal sending an email dated 4 July 2008 with a letter to Shanghai Electric's VicePresident proposing the assignment of a contract to Reliance (UK) for Shanghai Electric's acceptance, signed by Mr Agrawal, in which he is described as Reliance Infrastructure's \"Authorized Signatory\",[161] and him sending an email dated 26 August 2008 communicating to Shanghai Electric that guarantee letters would be furnished for a number of power plant projects on Reliance Infrastructure's \"behalf\".[162]\n138While the representations of the apparent authority of the agent must emanate from the principal and not the agent, and Mr Agrawal's conduct alone cannot cloak himself with ostensible authority to act for Reliance Infrastructure, apparent authority can arise from the principal's representations by conduct, the most common form of which involves its acquiescence in the agent's consistent course of dealings with third parties (Freeman & Lockyer at 498). Here, the length of time and frequency of Mr Agrawal's dealings with Shanghai Electric support the inference that Reliance Infrastructure must have known of and acquiesced in Mr Agrawal dealing with Shanghai Electric on its behalf on matters relating to the power plant projects they were both involved in. Thus, Reliance Infrastructure impliedly represented that he had their authority to do so (Freeman & Lockyer at 498).\n139Of course, if each of the above acts are taken strictly in isolation, various arguments may be made attacking the strength of the individual representations. Distinctions may be drawn between negotiating contracts and concluding contracts or between signing a contract for Reliance (UK) versus Reliance Infrastructure. The critical point, however, is to assess the representations in the round and not as discrete acts. The overall impression given by Reliance Infrastructure was that Mr Agrawal was heavily involved in the business dealings between Shanghai Electric and Reliance Group entities and handled many relevant arrangements and negotiations for the conclusion of contracts relating to the power plant projects that the Parties were engaged in, including the Sasan Project. Thus, he was cloaked with apparent authority to enter into any contracts in the ordinary course of such business dealings (Freeman & Lockyer at 505). There was nothing unusual about the Guarantee Letter, and it was conceded by Reliance Infrastructure's own witness, Mr Agrawal, that it had been contemplated by Parties.[163]\n140Looked at in its totality, we find that this consistent course of conduct gave rise to the representation that Mr Agrawal had authority to sign the Guarantee Letter and to make the arbitration agreement.\n141We conclude that Reliance Infrastructure, having had knowledge of the underlying facts to mount its objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, on the grounds of both forgery and want of authority, and lacking good reason not to do so, must now be deemed to have waived its rights to make those arguments here by its failure to pursue those objections to jurisdiction in the SIAC arbitration.\n142This finding is, of course, fatal to Reliance Infrastructure's setting aside application; however, for completeness, we find that, in any event, the objections raised were without merit. We would have dismissed them even if Reliance Infrastructure had not waived its right to pursue them.\n143Consequently, we dismiss Reliance Infrastructure's application to set aside the Award in SIC/OA 1/2023. We also award costs to Shanghai Electric. If parties are unable to agree on the amount of costs within 14 days of the date of this judgment, they are to file within 7 days thereafter submissions on costs limited to ten pages each, excluding any tables of time spent or work done.",

Applicants\nAnd\nGreylag Goose Leasing 1410 Designated Activity Company\nGreylag Goose Leasing 1446 Designated Activity Company\n... Non-parties\njudgment\n1 The present application, SIC/OA 5/2022 (\"OA 5\"), is brought by Mr Irfan Setiaputra (\"Mr Setiaputra\") and Mr Prasetio (collectively, the \"Applicants\"), in their capacity as foreign representatives of PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (\"Garuda Indonesia\"), an Indonesian state-owned limited liability company, for the recognition of foreign proceedings and upon recognition, relief in terms of recognition and enforcement of a restructuring plan. The application is made under the Third Schedule (the \"Third Schedule\") of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) (the \"IRDA\"), which sets out the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (30 May 1997) (the \"Model Law\") promulgated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\"), as adopted in Singapore.\n2 The Applicants seek, amongst others, the following orders for recognition and relief to be granted in support of Garuda Indonesia's restructuring proceeding in Indonesia:\n(a) An order recognising Suspension of Payment Case No.425/Pdt.Sus-PKPU/2021/PN.Niaga.Kjt.Pst (the \"PKPU Proceeding\") filed on 22 October 2021 in the Jakarta Commercial Court as a foreign main proceeding within the meaning of Article 2(f) of the Third Schedule.\n(b) An order recognising the Applicants as foreign representatives within the meaning of Article 2(i) of the Third Schedule.\n(c) An order staying all claims, enforcement, execution, and dealings against Garuda Indonesia and/or its assets under Article 20 of the Third Schedule.\n(d) An order recognising and enforcing the restructuring plan (the \"Composition Plan\") approved by the PKPU Proceeding and homologated by the Jakarta Commercial Court on 27 June 2022 as a foreign order and to grant any appropriate relief under Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule.\n(e) An order entrusting the Applicants with the administration and realisation of all or any part of Garuda Indonesia's property and assets in Singapore, to effectuate and/or to implement the Composition Plan.\n3 The non-parties in the present case are Greylag Goose Leasing 1410 Designated Activity Company (\"Greylag 1410\") and Greylag Goose Leasing 1446 Designated Activity Company (\"Greylag 1446\") (collectively, the \"Greylag Entities\"). The Greylag Entities do not challenge that the PKPU Proceeding is a foreign main proceeding within the meaning of Article 2(f) of the Third Schedule. Instead, their grounds of opposition are two-fold. First, that OA 5 was filed prematurely in light of pending proceedings before the Indonesian courts that might lead to the annulment of the Composition Plan and hence extinguish the substratum upon which OA 5 was brought. Second, that recognition of the PKPU Proceeding would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore under Article 6 of the Third Schedule.\n4 Prior to the hearing of OA 5, the Greylag Entities filed SIC/SUM 34/2023 (\"SUM 34\") for an order that the Applicants produce certain categories of documents requested by the Greylag Entities. The documents related to the impact of the Composition Plan on Garuda Indonesia's subsidiary company, Garuda Indonesia Holiday France (\"Garuda France\"). SUM 34 was filed on 12 September 2023 following a request for production of documents that was served by the solicitors for the Greylag Entities on 28 August 2023 on the solicitors for the Applicants, which the latter rejected on 7 September 2023. We dismissed SUM 34 on 25 September 2023, the first day of the hearing of OA 5, with costs reserved pending the determination of OA 5. We address SUM 34 in detail at [36]-[44] below.\n5 Having considered the parties' submissions, we allow the Applicants' application in OA 5 for the PKPU Proceeding to be recognised as a foreign main proceeding in Singapore. In so doing, we dismiss the two grounds of objections raised by the Greylag Entities. We further grant the reliefs sought by Garuda Indonesia as set out at [2] above. We add, however, that our orders granting the mandatory stay of proceedings under Article 20 of the Third Schedule and recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan under Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule are subject to terms which are set out at [161]-[162] below.\n6 Garuda Indonesia is the national airline of the Republic of Indonesia (the \"ROI\"). It is a full-service airline. Its business operations include providing domestic and international passenger travel, cargo services, reservation and IT services, hospitality and catering services, and repair and maintenance services. It is domiciled in Central Jakarta, and has its registered office at Garuda Indonesia Building, Jalan Kebon Sirih No 46A, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia (the \"Jakarta Office\"). Its principal place of business is located at the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta's main international airport. All its directors and a majority of its employees are Indonesian nationals. Garuda Indonesia's board meetings take place in Indonesia, and key business decisions are made in its Jakarta Office.\n7 Garuda Indonesia is a publicly listed company on the Indonesian stock exchange. Its largest shareholder is the ROI, which holds (a) one share of Series A \"Dwiwarna\" (or \"Golden Share\") entitling the ROI to certain stipulated privileges under Article 5 (4.c) of Garuda Indonesia's Articles of Association, and (b)approximately 60.536% of Garuda Indonesia's Series B shares . The remainder of the Series B shares are owned by PT Trans Airways (28.265%) and the general public (collectively holding 11.199% and with each shareholder holding less than 5%). As noted earlier, Garuda Indonesia is the parent company of Garuda France. Garuda France's business operations are based in France.\n8 Garuda Indonesia has been registered in Singapore as a foreign company since 11 August 1952 and has operated flights in and out of Singapore since 1966. It maintains an office at Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 3. Its assets in Singapore include aircraft physically located in Singapore from time to time as well as cash.\n9 The Applicants are officers of Garuda Indonesia. Mr Setiaputra is Garuda Indonesia's President and Chief Executive Officer while Mr Prasetio is the director of the finance and risk management department of Garuda Indonesia. They were appointed by Garuda Indonesia's board of directors as the airline's joint foreign representatives for the purpose of OA 5.\n10 The Greylag Entities are two of Garuda Indonesia's creditors. They are also creditors of Garuda France. The Greylag Entities are the lessors of two Airbus aircraft (collectively, the \"Aircraft\"). The first is an Airbus A330-200 aircraft bearing Manufacturer's Serial Number 1410 (\"Aircraft 1410\"); the second is an Airbus A330-300 aircraft bearing Manufacturer's Serial Number 1446 (\"Aircraft 1446\").\nThe debts owed by Garuda Indonesia to the Greylag Entities\n11 The debts owed by Garuda Indonesia to the Greylag Entities arose under two lease arrangements that involved the Greylag Entities, Garuda France, and Garuda Indonesia in respect of the Aircraft (the \"Aircraft Leases\").\n12 The original lessor of Aircraft 1410 was Denpasar Aircraft Leasing (Ireland) Limited (\"DAL\"), and the original lessor of Aircraft 1446 was Surabaya Aircraft Leasing (Ireland) Limited (\"SAL\"). The lessee of the Aircraft was Garuda France. By way of novation agreements entered into on 28 October 2016 between DAL, Garuda France, and Greylag 1410 (in respect of Aircraft 1410) and between SAL, Garuda France, and Greylag 1446 (in respect of Aircraft 1446) (the \"Aircraft Headleases\"), the Greylag Entities became the lessors of the Aircraft. Garuda France remained the lessee of the Aircraft. By way of two agreements dated 28 October 2016 (the \"Aircraft Subleases\"), Garuda France sub-leased the Aircraft to Garuda Indonesia on terms similar to those in the head-lease agreement between the respective original lessors (ie , DAL and SAL) and Garuda France.\n13 On 27 September 2019, the Aircraft Subleases were amended to record the Greylag Entities as the new lessors of the respective Aircraft. At the same time, the parties also entered into two sets of agreements. The first set comprised two subordination agreements (the \"Subordination Agreements\") in connection with the leasing arrangements for the Aircraft. The second set comprised two security agreements respectively (the \"Security Agreements\") between Garuda France and Greylag 1410 (for Aircraft 1410), and between Garuda France and Greylag 1446 (for Aircraft 1446).\n14 Paragraph 4(a) of each of the Subordination Agreements provides, in effect, that Garuda Indonesia's rights under the Aircraft Subleases \"are subject and subordinate in all respects\" to the rights of the Greylag Entities under the Aircraft Headleases and the Security Agreements. Crucially, paragraph 12 of the Subordination Agreements prescribes that upon the giving of notice by Garuda France to Garuda Indonesia informing the latter that the Greylag Entities' security interests under the Security Agreements had become enforceable, the Greylag Entities will be entitled to:\n(a) exercise \"all the rights, powers and discretions\" that Garuda France might have under the Aircraft Subleases and \"any other Operative Documents (as defined in the [Aircraft Subleases]\"; and\n(b) require the payment of all money payable by Garuda Indonesia under the Aircraft Subleases and any other Operative Documents to be directed to any bank accounts indicated by the Greylag Entities.\n15 By letters dated 28 January 2020, 13 February 2020, 27 April 2020 and 4 January 2022, the Greylag Entities issued notices to Garuda Indonesia and Garuda France declaring, among others, what it termed \"Events of Defaults\". Following these notices, Garuda Indonesia became indebted to the Greylag Entities pursuant to the Greylag Entities' rights under the Subordination Agreements described above.\nThe nature of a PKPU restructuring proceeding\n16 On 22 October 2021, PT Mitra Buana Korporindo, a creditor of Garuda Indonesia, filed a petition to commence a \" PenundaanKewajiban Pembayaran Utang \" or \"PKPU\" proceeding (meaning \"suspension of payments\" proceeding) under Indonesian law. The petition (the \"PKPU Petition\") was filed in accordance with Law No 37 of 2004 on Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Repayment Obligations in Indonesia. Upon the filing of the PKPU Petition and commencement of the PKPU Proceeding, an automatic stay arose against all enforcement efforts by Garuda Indonesia's creditors against Garuda Indonesia and its assets.\n17 The purpose of a PKPU proceeding is to aid a corporate debtor to prepare and propose to its creditors a composition plan to restructure the debts of the company, ultimately with the aim of avoiding the debtor's liquidation. Once a plan is prepared, it is presented and put to a vote by the creditors. The composition plan is deemed to be accepted if a simple majority in number of both the unsecured creditors and the secured creditors holding at least two-thirds in value of the admitted unsecured and secured claims respectively vote in favour of the composition plan (the \"Requisite Threshold\"). Once the Requisite Threshold is reached, the composition plan will be presented to the court for homologation, ie , ratification, of the plan.\n18 The PKPU Proceeding is, for all intents and purposes, a debtor-in-possession restructuring process where the debtor entity, in this case Garuda Indonesia, continues to retain the property to which the creditors may have a right, and to be responsible for the administration of its assets and day-to-day operations, subject to oversight by the administrators. Any decision made by the corporate debtor's board of directors in respect of the debtor's assets, including incurring further liabilities against those assets, however, is subject to approval by the administrators.\nThe PKPU Proceeding\n19 On 9 December 2021, the Jakarta Commercial Court granted the PKPU Petition declaring Garuda Indonesia to be in temporary PKPU (the \"Temporary PKPU Order\") for an initial period of 44 days. A team of six administrators was appointed to oversee the restructuring. This signalled the commencement of the PKPU Proceeding. Despite the appointment of administrators to oversee the restructuring of Garuda Indonesia's debts, Garuda Indonesia's management continued to be responsible for its day-to-day as the PKPU Proceeding was a debtor-in-possession restructuring process, as noted earlier. A supervising judge from the Jakarta Commercial Court was appointed to oversee the PKPU Proceeding. The Temporary PKPU Order effectively suspended all of Garuda Indonesia's payment obligations for 44 days from the date of the decision. Thus, Garuda Indonesia was provided breathing space to work with its creditors and stakeholders to prepare a draft composition plan to facilitate the restructuring of Garuda Indonesia's debts. The Temporary PKPU Order was subsequently extended for a further 152 days.\nThe Composition Plan\n20 The development of the Composition Plan commenced shortly after the Temporary PKPU Order was granted. On 12 November 2021, Garuda Indonesia circulated a restructuring term sheet with the key commercial terms of the restructuring plan to its creditors (the \"Draft Composition Plan\"). A revised version of the Draft Composition Plan was circulated to the creditors on 17 November 2021 following further negotiations and comments by various creditors. Further meetings between Garuda Indonesia and its creditors took place between May and June 2022, during which the Draft Composition Plan was amended to accommodate additional concerns raised by the creditors.\n21 The final version of the Draft Composition Plan was prepared after these negotiations concluded. Amongst other objectives, the Composition Plan sought to distribute a total of US$825m to Garuda Indonesia's creditors, including its preferred creditors, trade creditors and financing creditors. In addition, Garuda Indonesia would undertake a rights issue, the amount of which would be calculated pursuant to a prescribed formula in the Draft Composition Plan. All of this was done with the view of improving and enhancing Garuda Indonesia's financial performance by compromising the debts of all creditors whose debts had been admitted by Garuda Indonesia's administrators.\n22 The Draft Composition Plan was subsequently put to a vote at a creditors' meeting on 17 June 2022. The creditors' meeting was by all accounts a success, with 95.07% of the admitted creditors attending representing 97.46% of the total value of the debt voting in favour of the Draft Composition Plan, thereby satisfying the Requisite Threshold. The Composition Plan was subsequently homologated by the Jakarta Commercial Court on 27 June 2022 (the \"Homologation Decision\").\n23 It is important to note that the Greylag Entities participated in the PKPU Proceeding. In particular, they had registered their claims by submitting their claim form to the administrators, negotiated with Garuda Indonesia regarding the terms of the Aircraft Leases, and made submissions and voted against the Composition Plan at the creditors' meeting on 17 June 2022.\nChallenges by the Greylag Entities against the Composition Plan and the Homologation Decision\n24 The Greylag Entities filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia (the \"Indonesian Supreme Court\") challenging the Homologation Decision. The appeal was advanced on two grounds. First, it was alleged that the debt which was admitted in the PKPU Proceeding was incorrect as certain aspects of the Greylag Entities' claim were not considered. Second, it was alleged that Garuda Indonesia had breached the Aircraft Subleases whilst the PKPU Proceeding was ongoing. The appeal was dismissed by the Indonesian Supreme Court on 26 September 2022. The dismissal of the appeal made the Composition Plan final and binding on Garuda Indonesia and its creditors. Accordingly, the Composition Plan was to be implemented by 1 January 2023.\n25 Dissatisfied with the dismissal of the appeal, the Greylag Entities applied again to the Indonesian Supreme Court for a civil review of the court's decision to dismiss the appeal (the \"Civil Review Application\"). The objections raised in the Civil Review Application were similar to those raised in the appeal. The Civil Review Application was also dismissed by the Indonesian Supreme Court on 16 August 2023.\n26 Finally, the Greylag Entities filed an application to the Jakarta Commercial Court on 7 February 2023 to nullify the Homologation Decision based on an alleged breach of the Composition Plan (the \"Nullification Application\"). The objections and arguments raised by the Greylag Entities were similar to those raised in the appeal and the Civil Review Application. The Nullification Application was dismissed on 31 August 2023. The Greylag Entities filed an appeal against that decision on 8 September 2023 (the \"Nullification Appeal\"). The Nullification Appeal is pending before the Indonesian Supreme Court at the time of the hearing of OA 5.\n27 It is common ground between the parties that save for the Nullification Appeal, which is pending, there are no further avenues for the Greylag Entities to challenge the Homologation Decision and the Composition Plan under Indonesian law.\nOther insolvency proceedings involving Garuda Indonesia\n28 For completeness, we note that besides OA 5, several other insolvency proceedings relating to Garuda Indonesia and Garuda France were commenced in various jurisdictions. We briefly detail them.\nProceedings before the SDNY\n30 The Applicants then brought a separate application on 29 November 2022 seeking to enforce the Composition Plan in the US. The Greylag Entities also resisted this application on various grounds. On 24 May 2023, however, the Applicants withdrew the application. As it stands, therefore, there is no application for recognition of the PKPU Proceeding and consequent relief pending before the SDNY.\nProceedings in Australia\n31 Two winding-up applications were filed against Garuda Indonesia in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (\"NSWSC\"). The first was an application brought by eight creditors on 4 June 2021. That application was discontinued on 11 August 2021.\n32 The second was an application filed by the Greylag Entities on 15 August 2022 seeking to wind up Garuda Indonesia under s 583 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). That application was dismissed, with the NSWSC accepting Garuda Indonesia's defence premised on state immunity under the Australian Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 (Cth): see Greylag Goose Leasing 1410 Designated Activity Co v PT Garuda Indonesia Ltd [2022] NSWSC 1623.\nProceedings in France\n33 Finally, the Greylag Entities brought two proceedings in the French courts. The first was a liquidation proceeding commenced on 17 August 2022 against Garuda France in the Paris Commercial Court on the basis that Garuda France was a debtor of the Greylag Entities. The application was dismissed on 25 November 2022.\n34 The second was an application filed on 27 June 2022 in the Paris Civil Court seeking an attachment order of Garuda France's bank accounts. Garuda France applied to set aside the attachment order, and the application was allowed on 9 February 2023.\n35 Having set out the background to the PKPU Proceeding, we turn to address the substantive issues in OA 5. However, before we do that, we first address the Greylag Entities' application for production of documents in SUM 34. We heard SUM 34 on the first day of the hearing of OA 5 and dismissed it, providing brief reasons then. Our full reasons are set out hereinafter.\nSUM 34\n36 The documents (collectively, the \"Requested Documents\") that the Greylag Entities sought production of may be classified based on the following categories:\n(a) Documents describing the background and business purposes underlying Garuda Indonesia's decision to utilise the structure involving the Aircraft Headleases and Aircraft Subleases (see [11]-[15] above), including Garuda Indonesia's internal memoranda and board minutes, as well as any reports of accountants and advisers to Garuda Indonesia (the \"Commercial Background Documents\").\n(b) Documents showing: (i) the reasons for providing in the Composition Plan for the release of debts owed by Garuda France (the \"Third-Party Release Provisions\") as contained in any of the records of the PKPU Proceeding; and (ii) the reasoning and legal basis of the Third-Party Release Provisions as set out in in the Homologation Decision (the \"Explanatory Records\").\n(c) The consolidated financial statements of Garuda Indonesia and its subsidiaries and the non-consolidated financial statements of Garuda Indonesia and Garuda France as of: (a) 31 December 2021; (b) 31 December 2022; and (c) the date on which the Greylag Entities' request to produce was filed, ie , 28 August 2023 (the \"Financial Statements\").\nThe parties' submission\n37 SUM 34 was brought under O 12 r 4 of the Singapore International Commercial Court Rules 2021 (the \"SICC Rules\"). The parties' contentions as regards the disclosure of the Requested Documents turned on the materiality of the Requested Documents to the issues in OA 5. In our view, for the application to succeed, the Greylag Entities must show that the Requested Documents were sufficiently material to the issues raised, namely that the PKPU Proceeding should not be recognised for public policy reasons.\n38 The Greylag Entities submitted that the Requested Documents were material because they related to the issue of whether enforcement of the Composition Plan would be in breach of Singapore public policy. These documents purportedly supported the Greylag Entities' submission that the inclusion of the Third-Party Release Provisions in the Composition Plan was without adequate disclosure of information regarding Garuda France's financial position. This, in turn, precluded Garuda Indonesia's creditors from being able to make an informed decision before voting on the Draft Composition Plan, thus rendering the conduct of the PKPU Proceeding contrary to Singapore public policy.\n39 The Applicants submitted that the Requested Documents were not material because they did not concern whether Garuda Indonesia's creditors had been provided with sufficient information to determine the impact of the Third-Party Release Provisions on their claims against Garuda France.\n40 The Applicants further argued that SUM 34 was an abuse of process because:\n(a) SUM 34 was filed in disregard of the procedures provided under O 12 of the SICC Rules. In particular, the Greylag Entities unilaterally issued the request to produce documents without obtaining leave or an order of the court as required under O 12 r 2 of the SICC Rules.\n(b) SUM 34 was filed for the collateral purpose of delaying the resolution of OA 5.\nOur decision on SUM 34\n41 In our judgment, the Greylag Entities were not able to show how the Requested Documents were material to the issue of public policy.\n42 Turning first to the Commercial Background Documents, the Greylag Entities submitted that these documents were material in identifying the nexus between the \"business reasons\" behind the Aircraft Leases (see [11]-[15] above) and the release of Garuda France under the Composition Plan. We did not agree with this submission. We struggled to see how the commercial purpose in organising the Aircraft Leases of the Aircraft in the way that Garuda Indonesia and Garuda France had done, had anything to do with the inclusion of the Third-Party Release Provisions in the Composition Plan. More importantly, we did not see how these documents were even related to the issue of public policy in so far as the Greylag Entities' complaint was that there was an inadequate disclosure of financial information contrary to the creditors' interests.\n43 The Explanatory Records and Financial Statements were similarly not material. The Greylag Entities submitted that the common thread running through the Requested Documents was that they would show the reasons why the Third-Party Release Provisions were incorporated in the Composition Plan and whether those provisions were fair in the circumstances. We did not agree. The Explanatory Records were not material because the commercial reasons for including the Third-Party Release Provisions did not assist in understanding whether Garuda Indonesia's creditors received adequate financial disclosure or were treated equally. Similarly, in so far as the Financial Statements were requested to ascertain if the Composition Plan had been implemented and the purported financial impact of the recognition application sought by Garuda Indonesia in OA 5, we failed to see how this would be material to the issue of public policy raised by the Greylag Entities, namely the fair treatment of creditors and adequate disclosure of financial information. To this end, we accepted the Applicants' submission that the disclosure of the Financial Statements after the Composition Plan had been voted upon had no bearing on whether there was in fact adequate disclosure at the time the Composition Plan was put to vote. That issue could be decided without disclosure of the Financial Statements.\n44 Accordingly, we dismissed SUM 34 with costs to be determined following the conclusion of OA 5. As we were satisfied that SUM 34 should be dismissed on the ground that the Requested Documents were not material to the issues raised in OA 5, we did not think it necessary to consider the Applicants' alternative submission that SUM 34 should be dismissed as an abuse of process. We now turn to address the substantive issues in OA 5.\nObjections raised by the Greylag Entities against recognition\n45 We note at the outset that the Greylag Entities do not take issue with any of the formal and substantive requirements for recognition of a foreign proceeding in Article 17 of the Third Schedule. As noted above, they also do not contest that the jurisdiction where the PKPU Proceeding was conducted, ie , Indonesia, is where Garuda Indonesia has its \"centre of main interest\" (\"COMI\"). Accordingly, the PKPU Proceeding must be recognised as a \"foreign main proceeding\" within the meaning of Article 17(2)(a) of the Third Schedule.\n46 As stated above, the Greylag Entities resist OA 5 on two grounds. First, they argue in their written submission filed on 12 April 2023 that OA 5 is premature in view of several outstanding proceedings. These include: (a) the various applications and appeals filed before the Indonesian courts (see [24]-[27] above) that if successful, would affect the foundation upon which the PKPU Proceeding was recognised and relief in terms of enforcement of the Composition Plan was granted; and (b) the application brought by the Applicants before the SDNY seeking recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan in the US under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code, and which the Greylag Entities sought to resist.\n47 We note that at the time of the hearing of OA 5, most of the objections and challenges have been dismissed by the Indonesian courts (save for the Nullification Appeal which is pending before the Indonesian Supreme Court (see [26] above)). Further, Garuda Indonesia has, on 24 May 2023, withdrawn its application before the SDNY to enforce the Composition Plan in the US (see [30] above). Given these developments, it is necessary for us to consider only the Nullification Appeal in determining the first of the Greylag Entities' objections relating to the prematurity of the application. However, we should add that counsel for the Greylag Entities, Mr Muralli Raja Rajaram (\"Mr Rajaram\") did not pursue this objection at the hearing of OA 5.\n48 Turning to the second objection, the Greylag Entities submit that recognition of the PKPU Proceeding ought to be denied as it would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore under Article 6 of the Third Schedule for the following reasons:\n(a) The PKPU Proceeding and the voting on the Composition Plan were conducted without equitable treatment of the creditors. In particular, the Composition Plan allegedly favoured or prejudiced Garuda Indonesia's unsecured creditors by offering different terms to each creditor, such that the extent to which each unsecured creditor was favoured or prejudiced was dissimilar. Despite this dissimilarity in treatment, the Composition Plan was put to vote with all unsecured creditors placed in the same class.\n(b) The PKPU Proceeding and the voting on the Composition Plan was conducted without adequate disclosure of information. The Composition Plan sought, amongst others, to release the debts of Garuda France despite it not being a party to the PKPU Proceeding. Despite this, the administrators of Garuda Indonesia failed to disclose information relating to the financial position of, inter alios, Garuda France. Thus, the Composition Plan was put to a vote without adequate financial disclosure.\n49 We elaborate on the Greylag Entities' arguments on these two grounds in greater detail below.\nPreliminary observations\n50 Before we turn to our analysis on the objections raised by the Greylag Entities, we make three observations on OA 5.\nRecognition of the PKPU Proceeding\n51 Our first observation relates to the requirements for recognising foreign proceedings under the framework of the Third Schedule. As stated above, the Greylag Entities do not take issue with any of the formal and substantive requirements for recognition prescribed in Article 17 of the Third Schedule. We nevertheless consider whether the Applicants have satisfied the essential elements for recognition of the PKPU Proceeding, given that they bear the burden of establishing their case in OA 5.\n52 Article 17 of the Third Schedule provides that the court must recognise a proceeding if:\n(a) it is a foreign proceeding within the meaning of Article 2(h) of the Third Schedule;\n(b) the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body within the meaning of Article 2(i) of the Third Schedule;\n(c) the application meets the requirements of Articles 15(2) and (3); and\n(d) the application has been submitted to the General Division of the High Court in Singapore.\n... a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign State, including an interim proceeding, under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the property and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation.\n54 In United SecuritiesSdn Bhd (in receivership and liquidation) and another v United Overseas Bank Ltd [2021] 2 SLR 950 (\" United Securities \"), the Court of Appeal recognised (at [53]) that the following cumulative requirements must be satisfied for a proceeding to qualify as a \"foreign proceeding\" under Article 2(h) of the Third Schedule:\n(a) the proceeding must be collective in nature;\n(b) the proceeding must be conducted under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt;\n(c) the property and affairs of the debtor company must be subject to control or supervision by a foreign court in that proceeding; and\n(d) the proceeding must be for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation.\n55 Article 2(f) provides that a \"foreign main proceeding\" is a foreign proceeding taking place in the State where the debtor has its COMI. While the Third Schedule does not define what constitutes a debtor's COMI, Article 16(3) recognises the presumption that \"the debtor's registered office is presumed to be the debtor's centre of main interests\".\n56 Turning to the facts of this matter, we are satisfied that these requirements are made out and that the PKPU Proceeding constitute a foreign main proceeding.\n57 As described above (at [16]-[19]), the PKPU Proceeding is a judicial proceeding taking place under the supervision of the Jakarta Commercial Court. The legal basis for the proceeding is Law No 37 of 2004 on Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Repayment Obligations, which is the relevant insolvency legislation under Indonesian law that prescribes the requirements and conditions for authorising and eventually sanctioning the PKPU Proceeding. The proceeding pertains to the adjustment of the debt of all of Garuda Indonesia's and, amongst others, Garuda France's creditors as evident from the Composition Plan, and therefore considers the rights and obligations of all creditors. Finally, as we noted at [6] above, Garuda Indonesia's registered office is located in Indonesia. The PKPU Proceeding therefore falls within the definition of a \"foreign main proceeding\".\n58 We are also satisfied that the Applicants are persons falling within the definition of a \"foreign representative\" as defined in Article 2(i) of the Third Schedule, and that Articles 15(2) and 15(3) of the Third Schedule are satisfied at the time of OA 5.\n59 Accordingly, we accept the Applicants' submission that, barring the Greylag Entities' objections raised under Article 6 of the Third Schedule, the PKPU Proceeding ought to be recognised as a foreign main proceeding.\nThe Gibbs Rule\n60 Our second observation relates to the rule of considerable vintage recognised by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Antony Gibbs & Sons v La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9Industrielle et Commerciale des M\u00e9taux (1890) 25 QBD 399 (\"the Gibbs Rule\"). Simply put, the Gibbs Rule states that a discharge of a debt is not effective unless it is in accordance with the law governing the debt. The Gibbs Rule thus creates a barrier against recognition of a foreign proceeding and/or a foreign restructuring plan and/or judgment, where such proceeding and the fruits of that proceeding involve the compromise or discharge of a debt governed by foreign law. In the present case, the Composition Plan involves the compromise of debts owed by Garuda Indonesia and, amongst others, Garuda France to the Greylag Entities under the Aircraft Leases which are governed by New York law.\n61 We note, however, that the parties rightly do not contend that the Gibbs Rule is applicable in the present case. This is because the present case falls squarely within the exception to that rule, namely that the Gibbs Rule does not apply where a creditor submits to the jurisdiction of a foreign court, either by submitting its claims in the foreign insolvency proceeding or otherwise agreeing to be bound thereby: see Global Distressed Alpha Fund 1Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo[2011] 1 WLR 2038 at [31]. Here, it is common ground that the Greylag Entities fully participated in the PKPU Proceeding. The evidence shows that the Greylag Entities had registered their claims with Garuda Indonesia's administrator by way of claim forms dated 5 January 2022. They were also kept in the loop on developments on the Composition Plan and voted against it at the creditors' meeting on 17 June 2022. By their conduct, the Greylag Entities had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Indonesian courts in the PKPU Proceeding. Having done so, they are now precluded from asserting that they are not bound by the Composition Plan by virtue of the Gibbs Rule.\n62 In any case, we note that the High Court has in Re Pacific Andes Resources Development Ltd and other matters [2018] 5 SLR 125 examined the soundness of this rule in the context of modern cross-border insolvency, and we agree with the analysis made therein. For present purposes, however, and given that OA 5 does not engage any issues relating to this rule, we say no more on the issue.\nThe approach to recognition of foreign proceedings\n63 Our final observation relates to the court's approach to hearing a recognition proceeding. We think it appropriate to consider this because an awareness of the underlying principles guiding the court's approach on recognition is crucial in shaping our analysis of the arguments raised by the Greylag Entities against recognition of the PKPU Proceeding.\n64 We begin by noting the following remarks of the General Division of the High Court in Re Rams Challenge Shipping Pte Ltdand other matters [2023] 3 SLR 787 (\" Re Rams \") concerning the scope of the recognition of foreign proceedings and court orders (at [10]):\n... there may be some outer boundaries, beyond which recognition may not be accorded. The precise limits would remain to be examined in subsequent cases. What is important to my mind is that a foreign order does not operate substantially outside what might properly be regarded as the proper purview of an insolvency or restructuring effort, though the modalities and detailed scope may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A strict analogy or parallel with Singapore insolvency or restructuring regimes is not necessary. I suspect most insolvency or restructuring orders the world over will be readily accommodated, though there may be outliers . Public policy considerations also may come into play. Otherwise, in most instances, the main consideration is the opportunity for local creditors to participate or be heard in the process: Re Tantleff at [78]; In re CGG SA 579 BR 716 (Bankr SDNY, 2017) at 720.\n[emphasis in italics]\n65 We agree with the observation in Re Rams , which in our view is consistent with the Model Law's efforts to advance the principle of modified universalism as noted in Roy Goode & Kristin Van Zwieten, Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law (Sweet & Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (\" Goode on Insolvency Law \") (at para 16-07):\nThe current trend, as exemplified by the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency ... is clearly in favour of a modified universalist approach, albeit with rather more territorial elements than may have been envisaged by the proponents of that approach. The key universalist elements are: (i) the concept of main proceedings in the State where the debtor has its COMI; ... (iii) overall control of the insolvency process by the office-holder in the main proceedings; (iv) treatment of all of the debtor's assets worldwide as constituting the estate administered by that office-holder; (v) the provision of assistance by local courts in the recovery of assets and pursuit of claims by the office holder in the main proceedings, and access of office holders to foreign courts. But some leeway is also given to the concept of territoriality to accommodate the legitimate expectations of local creditors in relation to local assets. Thus the opening of territorial proceedings is permitted in a State where the debtor has an establishment or assets although having its COMI elsewhere but the proceedings are limited to local assets, and will be governed by the local lex concursus, whose priority rules will continue to apply. So local creditors will preserve their rights and priorities under local law, while foreign creditors will be able to participate in the insolvency proceedings on an equal footing but on the basis of local law, not the law by which their rights would otherwise be governed.\n66 In Inre HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd[2008] 1 WLR 852 (\" HIH Casualty \"), the House of Lords opined that modified universalism, regarded as a principle of private international law, required that bankruptcy (whether personal or corporate) should be unitary and universal. Thus, national courts should, as far as is consistent with justice and the public policy of their States, strive to administer the estate of an insolvent company in cooperation with the court of the jurisdiction of the principal liquidation of the debtor, typically its place of incorporation. In Lord Hoffmann's words (see HIH Casualty at [6]):\nDespite the absence of statutory provision, some degree of international co-operation in corporate insolvency had been achieved by judicial practice. This was based upon what English judges have for many years regarded as a general principle of private international law, namely that bankruptcy (whether personal or corporate) should be unitary and universal. There should be a unitary bankruptcy proceeding in the court of the bankrupt's domicile which receives worldwide recognition and it should apply universally to all the bankrupt's assets.\n67 Thus, the goal of modified universalism is to ensure that all of the company's assets are distributed to its creditors under a single system of distribution. The Model Law gives effect to the principle of modified universalism through a procedural framework which not only permits but encourages cooperation and coordination between jurisdictions in cases of cross-border insolvencies: see Goode on Insolvency Law at para 16-07 cited above. Indeed, the principles of cooperation and coordination form one of the four key pillars of the Model Law's architecture: see UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency Law with Guide to Enactment and Interpretation , UN Sales No E.14.V.2 (2014) (\" 2013 Guide \") at pp 26-27.\n68 That the Model Law's focus is on providing an effective procedural framework for cooperation and coordination, instead of the unification of substantive insolvency law (see UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: The Judicial Perspective , UN Sales No 23.V.I (2022) (\" The Judicial Perspective \") at para 9), is premised on the reality that the insolvency regime in each State is designed to respond to and achieve its various unique economic and social policy objectives: see UNCITRAL Practice Guide on Cross-Border Insolvency Cooperation , UN Sales No E.10.V.6 (2010) at pp 9-10. Consequently, it is important, indeed necessary, to strike a balance between ensuring a coordinated and orderly management of creditors' claims and the distribution of assets involving a single debtor company operating in more than one jurisdiction on the one hand and maintaining the integrity of and respecting the insolvency legal framework of each State on the other.\n69 Put another way, modified universalism recognises that there are differences in the insolvency laws and procedures of each State but takes the view that such differences should not stand in the way of the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings and the benefits that would accrue to creditors as a collective whole through a global effort to coordinate the distribution of assets in a cross-border collapse.\n70 A corollary of this is the principle of comity. In the context of cross-border insolvency, the principle of comity (alongside cooperation) is paramount. It is \"the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws\": Hilton v Guyot , 159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895) (see also TheReecon Wolf [2012] 2 SLR 289 at [23], citing MorguardInvestments Ltd v De Savoye [1990] 3 SCR 1077 at 1096). Thus, the US Supreme Court in Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Gebhard , 109 U.S. 527 (1883) stated (at 539) that \"the true spirit of international comity requires that [an insolvency proceeding], legalized at home, should be recognized in other countries\".\n71 Consistent with these principles, a key aspect of comity requires that courts eschew an inquiry into the substantive merits of foreign law and the findings made by the foreign court in the foreign proceedings. This aspect of comity finds expression in the Court of Appeal's statement in AscentraHoldings, Inc (in official liquidation) and others v SPGK Pte Ltd [2023] 2 SLR 421 (\" Ascentra \"), where it was held (at [97]) that \"a light threshold should be imposed for recognition, which can then be tempered by granting recognition or relief subject to the imposition of appropriate conditions\". Although this was said in the context of considering whether Article 2(h) of the Third Schedule and in particular the words \"under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt\", require that recognition be granted only where the foreign proceeding involved a company that is either insolvent or in severe financial distress, we think this reflects the broader view that the application of foreign insolvency laws by the foreign court and the findings reached there should ordinarily be respected by the courts of the jurisdiction where recognition is sought: see The Judicial Perspective at paras 42 and 53.\n72 In this connection, counsel for the Applicants, Mr Emmanuel Duncan Chua (\"Mr Chua\"), submits that if the foreign insolvency proceeding sought to be recognised adheres to a set of minimum standards or requirements, such as the proper constitution of proceedings, adequate creditor and shareholder protection, and the accordance of due process, the courts should give full effect to such proceedings and orders. We agree, although we hasten to add that this is not an exhaustive list and a court hearing a recognition application ought to be sensitive to any other potential public policy objections (as discussed at [96] below). But this general view is nevertheless consistent with the views expressed by Chief Judge Martin Glenn (\"Chief Judge Glenn\") in the SDNY in Inre Modern Land (China) Co Ltd 641 BR 768 (albeit in a slightly different context) that (at 776):\n[p]rovided that the foreign court properly exercises jurisdiction over the foreign debtor in an insolvency proceeding, and the foreign court's procedures comport with broadly accepted due process principles, a decision of the foreign court approving a scheme or plan that modifies or discharges New York law governed debt is enforceable.\n73 With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the objections raised by the Greylag Entities under Article 6 of the Third Schedule.\nThe issues in OA 5\n74 The Greylag Entities' objections against recognition of the PKPU Proceeding and the grant of relief by recognising and enforcing the Composition Plan raise the following issues:\n(a) Whether recognition of the PKPU Proceeding should be denied on the basis that the application was brought prematurely in light of pending proceedings before the Indonesian courts (the \"Premature Application Objection\").\n(b) Whether recognition of the PKPU Proceeding should be denied on the basis that it would breach Singapore public policy (the \"Public Policy Objection\").\n(c) If recognition is granted, whether the court ought to grant the additional relief of recognising and enforcing the Composition Plan under Article 21 of the Third Schedule and if so, the appropriate terms of the orders to be granted reflecting such relief (the \"Relief Issue\").\nThe Premature Application Objection\n75 As stated above, the Greylag Entities' position under the Premature Application Objection is premised solely on the pending Nullification Appeal before the Indonesian Supreme Court. In our judgment, there is little force in the objection.\n76 To begin, the Greylag Entities have not referred us to any relevant provision in the Third Schedule in support of the objection. Indeed, there is simply no legal basis for objecting as such. On the contrary, the Greylag Entities' submission runs counter to the mandatory effect of giving recognition to a foreign proceeding once the requirements in Article 17 of the Third Schedule (see [52] above) are satisfied. This is clear from the language of Article 17 which provides that the foreign proceeding \" must be recognised\" [emphasis added]. Moreover, the 2013Guide , which is relevant to interpreting the Third Schedule (see Re Zetta Jet Pte Ltd and others (Asia Aviation Holdings Pte Ltd, intervener) [2019] 4 SLR 1343 at [37]), states (at paras 150-151) that recognition is \"limited to the jurisdictional pre-conditions\" set out in Article 17 and \"will be granted as a matter of course\" once those pre-conditions are met.\n77 We accept the Applicants' submission that Article 17 of the Third Schedule does not require a foreign proceeding to be concluded, or that all avenues of appeal and review must be exhausted in the foreign jurisdiction before an application for recognition of the foreign proceeding is brought. A recognition application may be brought under the Third Schedule soon after the commencement of the foreign proceeding. There is a clear necessity for the recognition application to be concluded as expeditiously as possible. This, in our view, is consistent with the practical effect of Article 17.\n78 The Greylag Entities' position fails to recognise that Article 17(4) was included in the Model Law (and in the Third Schedule), in part, precisely to deal with the situation where a foreign proceeding is subsequently terminated by the foreign court. Article 17(4) of the Third Schedule reads:\nThe provisions of Articles 15 to 16, this Article and Article 18 do not prevent modification or termination of recognition if it is shown that the grounds for granting it were fully or partially lacking or have fully or partially ceased to exist ; and in such a case, the Court may, on the application of the foreign representative or a person affected by the recognition, or of its own motion, modify or terminate recognition, either altogether or for a limited time, on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit.\n[emphasis added]\n79 As the 2013Guide makes clear (at paras 164-165), recognition of a foreign proceeding is \"subject to review or recission\" and this \"may be a consequence of a change of circumstances after the decision on recognition\". Thus, a recognition application granted by the Singapore courts can always be terminated if the substratum for granting that application no longer exists, such as where the order commencing the foreign proceeding has been reversed by an appellate court in the foreign State: see The Judicial Perspective at para 61(b).\n80 For these reasons, we do not accept the Greylag Entities' submission that the Nullification Appeal is a bar to the recognition of the PKPU Proceeding and enforcement of the Composition Plan as a consequent relief. In the event the Greylag Entities succeed in the Nullification Appeal, it is open to them to make an application to this court under Article 17(4) of the Third Schedule to request termination of both the recognition of the PKPU Proceeding and any ancillary reliefs granted in support of recognition.\nThe Public Policy Objection\nArticle 6 of the Third Schedule\n81 The architecture of the Model Law is structured in a way that seeks to facilitate the efficient recognition of foreign proceedings. Consistent with this objective are the limited avenues for resisting a recognition application. One such avenue is found in Article 6 of the Third Schedule, which reads:\nArticle 6. Public policy exception\nNothing in this Law prevents the Court from refusing to take an action governed by this Law if the action would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore.\n82 We observe that Article 6 of the Third Schedule is different from Article 6 of the Model Law in only one respect - the omission of the word \"manifestly\" before the words \"contrary to public policy\". The drafters of the Model Law included the term \"manifestly\" to emphasise that \"public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively, and that Article 6 of the Model Law is only intended to be invoked in exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State\": see 2013 Guide at para 104; see also The Judicial Perspective at para 52. The absence of the word \"manifestly\" in Article 6 of the Third Schedule may seem to suggest Parliament's intention that a lower threshold should apply for denying recognition on the public policy ground. The question that arises therefore under the Public Policy Objection is the standard which the court should adopt in examining an objection against recognition and relief premised on Article 6 of the Third Schedule.\n83 In this regard, the Greylag Entities refer to Re Zetta JetPte Ltd and others [2018] 4 SLR 801 (\" Zetta Jet \"), a decision in which the General Division of the High Court had the occasion to consider the effect of Article 6 of the Third Schedule. The court observed that there was no indication in the Parliamentary debates or any preparatory material to explain the omission of the word \"manifestly\", and that the omission \"had to be deliberate and conscious\" in light of the drafter's emphasis on the importance of the word \"manifestly\": see Zetta Jet at [22]. The omission therefore suggests, in the view of the court in Zetta Jet (at [23]):\n... the standard of exclusion on public policy grounds in Singapore is lower than that in jurisdictions where the Model Law has been enacted unmodified. That is, in Singapore, recognition may be denied on public policy grounds though such recognition may not be manifestly contrary to public policy.\nAccordingly, the Greylag Entities submit a lower threshold applies and a mere breach of public policy is sufficient to deny recognition.\n84 We are of the view that the omission of the word \"manifestly\" does not necessarily mean that the threshold for denying recognition on public policy grounds under Article 6 of the Third Schedule ought to be lower than under Article 6 of the Model Law. While we agree with the court in Zetta Jet that the word \"manifestly\" may be regarded as a deliberate omission, that alone is insufficient to conclude that a lower threshold for finding a breach of public policy was intended.\n85 We begin by noting that, as prescribed in s 252(2) of the IRDA, in interpreting provisions of the Third Schedule, regard may be had to documents forming part of the record on the preparation of the UNCITRAL Model Law, as well as the Cross-Border Insolvency: Guide to Enactment of the UNCITRALModel Law on Cross-Border Insolvency , 30th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.9/442 (1997) (the \" 1997 Guide \"). Furthermore, the 2013 Guide may be considered where the 1997 Guide is silent and to the extent that there is no conflict: see Ascentra at [47].\n86 The starting point is the distinction drawn in the 1997 Guide and the 2013 Guide between two conceptions of public policy. The first is public policy as defined and understood in the domestic context, which refers to mandatory rules of national law. We term this as \"domestic public policy\". The second is a more restricted conception of public policy as considered when dealing with the application of foreign law, or the recognition of a foreign court judgment/order or an international arbitral award. In this context, public policy takes on a narrower scope and relates only to fundamental principles of law. We term this as \"fundamental public policy\".\n87 Both the 1997 Guide and the 2013 Guide state that where matters of international cooperation and the recognition of the effects of foreign laws are concerned, it is fundamental public policy that is pertinent. This is because \"international cooperation would be unduly hampered if public policy would be understood in an extensive manner [ie , in the sense of domestic public policy]\": see 1997 Guide at para 88 and the 2013 Guide at para 103. With this in mind, both documents state that the inclusion of the term \"manifestly\" as a qualifier to the expression of \"public policy\" was to \" emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that Article 6 is only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State \" [emphasis added]: see 1997 Guide at para 89 and the 2013 Guide at para 104.\n88 It is therefore clear that the inclusion of the term \"manifestly\" is not meant to affect in any way the standard of \"public policy\" as contemplated and applied in Article 6 of the Model Law. Rather, its inclusion is to make explicit what was always implicitly understood to be the test when a public policy objection is raised as a challenge to the recognition, namely that a high threshold has to be met before recognition is refused. Put another way, the word \"manifestly\" does not add any further depth to the requirement but is simply included for the purposes of erasing doubt and giving clarity: see ReAgrokor DD [2018] 2 BCLC 75 at [109]. We therefore respectfully disagree with the decision in Zetta Jet that Parliament intended a lower threshold by removing \"manifestly\" in Article 6 of the Third Schedule.\n89 If as we have stated at [66] above the purpose of the Model Law is to advance the goals of modified universalism, one facet of this must be to require a high threshold before finding the recognition of a foreign proceeding to be in breach of Singapore public policy under Article 6 of the Third Schedule. Such a high threshold is also necessitated by the notion of comity as discussed at [63]-[72] above.\n90 That these principles and policy objectives are relevant to interpreting Article 6 of the Third Schedule is further supported by Article 8 of the Third Schedule, which states:\nArticle 8. Interpretation\nIn the interpretation of this Law, regard is to be had to its international origin and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith.\n[emphasis]\n91 Article 8 of the Third Schedule thus reinforces the need, when interpreting the provisions of the Third Schedule, to ensure that the resulting interpretation promotes both the purpose and objective of the Model Law and the goals of achieving uniformity and consistency in its application. To this end, the 2013 Guide notes that including Article 8 in the Model Law ensures that \"a State enacting a model law would have an interest in its harmonized interpretation\": see 2013 Guide at para 106. This, in turn, furthers the goals of cooperation and promotion of greater legal certainty in cross-border insolvency proceedings.\n92 Indeed, the interpretative trend amongst various foreign jurisdictions has recognised that Article 6 of the Model Law is to be applied restrictively: see, eg , In re Ernst & Young, Inc. , 383 BR 773, 781 (Bankr D Colo 2008); Re OGXPetr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s SA, Nordic Trustee ASA and another v OGX Petr\u00f3leo e G\u00e1s SA (Em Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o Judicial) and another [2017] 2 All ER 217 at [44]-[45]. While we note that the relevant legislation in these jurisdictions include the word \"manifestly\" under their equivalent of Article 6 of the Model Law, as stated above we do not think that this ought in any way to affect the applicable standard that should be adopted in scrutinising any challenges on public policy grounds. In line with the principles of interpretation set out under Article 8 of the Third Schedule, therefore, a challenge brought under Article 6 of the Third Schedule on the ground of public policy will succeed only in limited circumstances.\n93 We make one final point. The narrow conception of fundamental public policy also features in international arbitration. In particular, Article 34(2)(b)(ii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration permits the setting aside of a Singapore-seated international arbitral award where \"the award is in conflict with the public policy of [Singapore]\". Article V(2)(a) of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards similarly states that recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award may be refused if the recognition court finds that \"the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country\". Despite the absence \"manifestly\" it is well accepted that where enforcement of a foreign arbitral award is resisted on public policy grounds, the public policy objection in question must involve either \" exceptional circumstances ... which would justify the court in refusing to enforce the award\" or a violation of \"the most basic notions of morality and justice\" [emphasis added]: see AJU v AJT [2011] 4 SLR 739 at [38]. Indeed, this position was affirmed more recently by the Court of Appeal in BloomberryResorts and Hotels Inc and another v Global Gaming Philippines LLC and another [2021] 2 SLR 1279 at [162], where the court held that \"[t]he public policy objection pitched at a high threshold is thus necessarily of a narrow scope\". This position adopted therefore reflects the view that where arbitral awards are concerned, any ground of opposition premised on public policy will be upheld only in limited circumstances. This may perhaps explain why Parliament did not think it necessary to include the word \"manifestly\" when adopting Article 6 of the Model Law - simply because it is well-understood that where references to \"public policy\" in the context of foreign law and international awards or judgments are concerned, any challenge against the application thereof must be subject to a high threshold.\n94 Accordingly, we hold that the threshold for establishing the public policy exception under Article 6 of the Model Law is a high one. To this end, we agree with the Applicants' submission that applying a low threshold under Article 6 of the Third Schedule would permit creditors to stultify recognition proceedings on the basis of alleged breaches of public policy, however insignificant. This would allow a convenient escape route from recognition which would only serve to defeat modified universalism and is detrimental to the fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, the protection of creditor interests, the protection and maximisation of value, the protection of investment and the preservation of jobs.\n95 It therefore follows that any successful challenge against recognition on the basis of Article 6 of the Third Schedule must be narrow in scope; such a challenge will succeed only if the recognition and the grant of relief is contrary to the fundamental public policy of Singapore. We do not propose to state exhaustively the grounds of challenge, neither is it appropriate to do so. We venture to suggest, however, that the courts must be sensitive to procedural and substantive differences between domestic insolvency laws and foreign insolvency laws. The fact that foreign insolvency laws and procedures operate differently from what is normally expected and experienced in the domestic insolvency regime cannot, without more, give rise to a finding that the foreign proceeding is abhorrent and contrary to Singapore public policy: see StoczniaGdynia SA v Bud-Bank Leasing SP[2010] BCC 255 at [27]. Consonant with this view, we also think that the framework under the Third Schedule cannot be used as a device through which a domestic court scrutinises the substantive merits of a foreign insolvency court's decisions. Indeed, nothing in the Model Law's framework requires that a recognition court delve into the merits of a foreign insolvency proceeding. It would be undesirable to do so and contrary to the view that a recognition proceeding is a light-touch process.\n96 The situations where challenges brought under Article 6 of the Third Schedule are likely to succeed, may include the following (without being comprehensive):\n(a) where recognition is sought in respect of a foreign proceeding commenced in breach of a moratorium over legal proceedings (see, eg , In re Gold and Honey, Ltd 410 BR 357 (2009));\n(b) where the relief sought under the Model Law is prohibited in the forum state or where compliance with orders for such reliefs would open individuals to criminal prosecution (see, eg , In re Toft , 453 BR 186 (Bankr SDNY 2011));\n(d) where recognition is sought of a foreign proceeding commenced in breach of the recognising court's order granted in a prior proceeding (see ZettaJet at [25]); or\n(e) where there is a failure to accord due process to the creditors and other relevant stakeholders in the foreign insolvency process.\n97 The last situation is especially relevant to OA 5 and we discuss this further at [99]-[101] below.\n98 We also venture to tentatively suggest that Singapore public policy may also be engaged where the insolvency proceedings or foreign court orders are tainted by fraud. This is consistent with the position expressed by the High Court of England and Wales in ReDalnyaya Step LLC (in liquidation); Cherkasov and others v Nogotkov (Official Receiver of Dalnyaya Step LLC (in liquidation))[2017] EWHC 3153 (Ch) (at [89]), in the context of determining whether a foreign representative's failure to provide full and frank disclosure to the recognising court regarding allegedly fraudulent activities surrounding the liquidation of the foreign company, that such potential fraudulent activities may constitute grounds for invoking the public policy objection under Article 6 of the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No 1030) (UK) (\"CBIR 2006\"). Once again, while we note that Article 6 of the CBIR 2006 includes the word \"manifestly\", we do not think this changes the analysis for the reasons given at [84]-[94] above.\n99 We turn to the requirement of due process. As stated above, this is especially relevant to OA 5. It is not disputed by the parties that creditors participating in a foreign proceeding must be accorded due process, and that this is a fundamental tenet of Singapore public policy. Indeed, in the context of a financially distressed or insolvent company, the interests of creditors assume central importance in the operation of the company. It is thus paramount that the creditors be notified of and be actively engaged in the steps that are being considered, whether that be to proceed with a corporate restructuring of the company's debts, or its liquidation and eventual distribution of assets on a paripassu basis. As Chief Judge Glenn observed in Inre Agrokor d.d 591 BR 163 (Bankr SDNY 2018) (at 184-185):\nA single court should resolve all claims to property of the debtor, which necessarily requires that the court resolve all creditor claims that have been, or could have been, asserted, provided that the creditors have received the notice required by due process.\n100 To this end, we agree with the United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit's holding in FinanzAG Zurich v Banco Economico SA , 192 F.3d 240 (2d Cir. 1999) that several key indicia of procedural fairness include (at 249):\n(1) whether creditors of the same class are treated equally in the distribution of assets; (2) whether the liquidators are considered fiduciaries and are held accountable to the court; (3) whether creditors have the right to submit claims which, if denied, can be submitted to a bankruptcy court for adjudication; (4) whether the liquidators are required to give notice to the [debtor's] potential claimants; (5) whether there are provisions for creditors meetings; (6) whether a foreign country's insolvency laws favor its own citizens; (7) whether all assets are marshalled before one body for centralized distribution; and (8) whether there are provisions for an automatic stay and for the lifting of such stays to facilitate the centralization of claims.\n101 Crucial to the principle of due process is the requirement that creditors be accorded the right to receive notice and to be accorded an opportunity to participate in the relevant insolvency proceedings and to have their views heard: see Inre Sivec Srl , Case No. 11-80799-TRC, 2011 WL 3651250, at 3 (Bankr. E.D. Okla. 2011). Thus, in Inre Avanti Commc'ns Grp. PLC , 582 BR 603 (Bankr SDNY 2018) (\" Avanti \"), Chief Judge Glenn recognised and enforced a scheme of arrangement, including a release of third-party guarantees, that was approved by creditors and by the High Court of England and Wales after being satisfied that \"Avanti's Scheme Creditors had a full and fair opportunity to vote on, and be heard in connection with, the Scheme\": see Avanti at 618.\n102 Also, we are of the view that the opportunity to be heard requires there be proper disclosure of relevant documents to creditors to enable them to make an informed decision when participating in the foreign insolvency proceedings. As we shall elaborate below, this aspect of due process is part of the broader requirement that creditors participating in foreign proceedings must be treated fairly.\n103 With these principles in mind and having considered the parties' submissions, it becomes clear that the factual and legal premises underlying the Public Policy Objection are unsustainable. This is because: (a) the facts do not, on closer inspection, raise any concerns regarding due process rights as the Greylag Entities allege; and (b) as will be discussed in detail below, the Public Policy Objection is in substance directed at the content of substantive Indonesian insolvency laws and the merits of the Homologation Decision. In short, the challenges raised are primarily on the merits disguised as public policy objections.\nThe alleged unfair treatment of creditors\n104 We turn to the first point raised by the Greylag Entities, namely that the PKPU Proceeding was conducted, and the resulting Composition Plan procured without the creditors being treated fairly and equitably and contrary to their expectations that due process would be accorded. We note that this objection was pursued with the greatest force by the Greylag Entities in its oral submissions.\nThe fair and equitable treatment of creditors\n105 In our view, the fair and equitable treatment of creditors is a fundamental tenet of Singapore public policy. Indeed, this flows from the universally recognised and accepted principle that the collective interest of creditors assumes central importance in the case of a financially distressed or insolvent company. The fair and equitable treatment of creditors is a principle that was considered by Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) in ReTaisoo Suk(as foreign representative of Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd) [2016] 5 SLR 787 (\" ReTaisoo Suk \"). That case involved an application for recognition brought under the common law regime, and Abdullah JC considered that a foreign rehabilitation proceeding should not be recognised if, amongst other requirements (at [20]):\n... those proceedings would lead to a result that would be unfair to the creditors as a whole, or which would not facilitate the orderly rehabilitation of the company. The primary factor is in the fairness of the process, particularly as regard the treatment of creditors. Foreign or international creditors should be treated fairly and equitably; any preference for domestic creditors or those of a particular group may be a strong reason for a court to decline recognition and assistance. Fairness would also encompass proper due process, which in this context would mean proper communication of plans and proposals, as well as the real possibility of participation in meetings by creditors: sufficient time and material must be given for due consideration by the creditors, including foreign or international creditors. The court will not, however, be so fastidious in the requirement of equality of creditors that it will not be practical at all to carry out the rehabilitation. Much will depend on the circumstances. Time will often be a considerable constraint, but as long as there are reasonable measures to ensure fair treatment, it is unlikely that the court will decline to recognise or assist.\n106 We agree with the passage above in ReTaisoo Suk . The safeguarding of creditors' interest requires that the court scrutinises whether the creditors have been accorded fair and equitable treatment of creditors by being able to participate meaningfully in the insolvency process. This is an aspect of their due process rights as stated at [101] above. We hasten to add, however, that not every perceived form of unfairness in the treatment of creditors would be sufficient to establish a breach of Singapore public policy. It is necessary for the party alleging a breach to clearly articulate how their right to fair and equitable treatment was violated.\n107 In evaluating whether there has been a breach of the right to fair and equitable treatment, we reiterate the observations made at [63]-[72] above regarding the approach to recognition of foreign proceedings. The focus is not on substantive law but on procedural fairness. And even in matters of procedure, the foreign proceedings need not mirror Singapore law. Without being exhaustive, the question is whether the affected creditors had a full and fair opportunity to vote, were given adequate disclosure of information to aid them in making an informed vote and had a full and fair opportunity to be heard in the foreign proceedings in a manner consistent with the standards of due process under Singapore law.\nThe Greylag Entities' submissions\n108 Turning to the circumstances surrounding the PKPU Proceeding, the Greylag Entities submit that the lack of proper classification of unsecured creditors for the purposes of voting on the Composition Plan evinces the unfair treatment of unsecured creditors. Their argument proceeds as such.\n110 The Greylag Entities submit that proper classification of Garuda Indonesia's unsecured creditors into further sub-classes was necessary as the terms offered to each of Garuda Indonesia's creditors under the Composition Plan (and hence the extent to which their rights under the Composition Plan as compared to an event of an insolvency were favoured or prejudiced) differed significantly. In particular, there are three aspects of the Composition Plan which the Greylag Entities contend where differential treatment was accorded and which therefore warranted different classification.\n111 The first is the different terms offered to unsecured creditors who were aircraft lessors, such as the Greylag Entities. The Composition Plan offered to such creditors the option of terminating the existing aircraft lease agreement ie , the Aircraft Leases in the case of the Greylag Entities. Should the affected creditor refuse this option, the Composition Plan then offered these creditors the following alternative options:\n(a) The first option, which was offered only to selected creditors, was the opportunity to continue the commercial relationship with Garuda Indonesia and be included in Garuda Indonesia's \"Go-Forward Fleet\" programme.\n(b) The second option, which was available to creditors not included under the \"Go-Forward Fleet\" programme, was the \"Alternative Lease Agreements\". Under this option, the affected creditors would propose alternative lease arrangements to Garuda Indonesia which Garuda Indonesia had the option of rejecting.\n112 Should the creditors not elect either option, the Composition Plan provided that the relevant aircraft lease would be terminated subject to the terms provided in the Composition Plan. The Greylag Entities allege that the manner in which the aircraft lessors were differentiated evidenced Garuda Indonesia's preference for selected unsecured creditors over others.\n113 The second relates to Garuda Indonesia's conduct of engaging in private negotiations with selected unsecured creditors pursuant to the alternative leasing arrangements under the Composition Plan. In particular, the Greylag Entities submits that these negotiations were conducted without the knowledge and participation of the other unsecured creditors, and the negotiated options available to these creditors were not offered to the rest of the unsecured creditors. Thus, unsecured creditors who could not participate in the private negotiations with Garuda Indonesia under the Alternative Lease Arrangements (including the Greylag Entities) had terms forced upon them.\n114 The third relates to the Composition Plan's effect of compromising debts owed by third-party subsidiaries of Garuda Indonesia to Garuda Indonesia's unsecured creditors. In particular, the debts released include those owed by Garuda France to as many as 74 aircraft lessors, pursuant to the Third-Party Release Provisions, all of whom had claims against Garuda France prior to the approval of the Composition Plan. Thus, the Greylag Entities' rights to pursue the debts owed by Garuda France to them under the Aircraft Leases were discharged under the Composition Plan.\n115 The Greylag Entities submit that these differences in the treatment of unsecured creditors rendered each of their rights so dissimilar from other unsecured creditors such that it was simply not sensible for all unsecured creditors to be put in the same class for the purposes of voting on the Composition Plan. Yet, all of Garuda Indonesia's unsecured creditors were placed in the same class. Accordingly, the manner in which the Composition Plan was put to a vote, namely without any proper classification and without an equal opportunity for all unsecured creditors to negotiate deals with Garuda Indonesia openly, amounts to treatment of all creditors that was neither fair nor equitable and was thus contrary to Singapore public policy.\nTreatment of creditors does not offend Singapore public policy\n116 We do not accept the Greylag Entities' submissions. In our view, the arguments are legally and factually unsustainable and plainly do not show that the PKPU Proceeding was conducted and the voting of the Composition Plan was procured in a manner contrary to Singapore public policy.\n117 The Greylag Entities' submission is legally unsustainable because it assumes that compliance with the requirements for proper creditor classification under Singapore law is a matter of Singapore public policy. Pathfinder and Wah Yuen , the authorities that the Greylag Entities rely on, considered the requirements for creditor classification under Singapore's restructuring regime as contained in s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2008 Rev Ed) (\"CA\"). Nothing in these decisions can be taken as recognising or mandating that the division of creditors into further sub-classes is a fundamental tenet of the fair and equitable treatment of creditors recognised as part of Singapore public policy such that these requirements must be met before a foreign restructuring or insolvency procedure may be recognised . Indeed, Mr Rajaram conceded as much when he accepted that creditor classification was not recognised as a matter of public policy by any jurisdiction.\n118 It appears to us that the true nature of the Greylag Entities' argument on the lack of classification of unsecured creditors is a criticism of the structure of the Indonesian insolvency regime, as opposed to an issue of fair and equitable treatment of creditors. It is common ground between the parties' Indonesian law experts that there was no requirement under Indonesian law for creditors to be classified in the manner required under Singapore law, and this was the subject of criticism by the Greylag Entities Indonesian law expert.\n119 According to the parties' Indonesian law experts, Indonesian insolvency law requires that creditors be classified under three categories - preferred, secured, and unsecured creditors - and only secured and unsecured creditors are eligible to vote on a composition plan. Crucially, the only requirement for the purposes of voting is that the debtor provide its creditors with the draft composition plan for a review of the offered repayment plan for all creditors. Once that is satisfied, all secured and unsecured creditors will vote in the same class . In other words, all unsecured creditors will be put in the same class for the purposes of voting, regardless of the different extent to which they are favoured or prejudiced under the composition plan relative to their positions in the event of the debtor's insolvency.\n120 Once this is appreciated, it becomes clear that the Greylag Entities essentially take issue with the lack of a requirement for further classification under Indonesian insolvency law, similar to the manner required under Singapore law. Such an argument seeks, impermissibly in our view, to examine the merits of Indonesian insolvency law by superimposing Singapore insolvency law with a view to identifying any perceived \"shortcomings\" under Indonesian insolvency law. In other words, whether Indonesian insolvency law affords proper and fair treatment of creditors is sought to be measured solely by the yardstick of Singapore's domestic insolvency law. Such a parochial and narrow approach is contrary to the spirit of modified universalism as envisaged by the Model Law. Ultimately, the Greylag Entities must show that the requirement for such kinds of classification is a fundamental tenet of Singapore public policy, which they have failed to do.\n121 Quite apart from this, we also think the Greylag Entities' submission is factually unsustainable. It is difficult to see how the mere fact that some unsecured creditors were offered repayment terms that differed from the rest is unfair or prejudicial so as to offend Singapore public policy. The parties' Indonesian law experts agree that there is no requirement under Indonesian law to offer the same repayment terms, as long as unsecured creditors within the same category are treated equally. Putting this aside, we agree with the Applicants that it is not sensible or practicable for a financially distressed or insolvent company to offer its creditors repayment on the same terms in light of the limited resources and funds. That is the reality of a restructuring process involving a financially distressed company and indeed the reality of most insolvency regimes. For a restructuring plan to be commercially viable and successful, some aspect of differentiated creditor treatment must be expected.\n122 There is also nothing untoward or inherently objectionable with Garuda Indonesia deciding which of its unsecured creditors it wishes to continue its commercial relationship with; indeed, nothing under Singapore's domestic insolvency and restructuring jurisprudence would find this to be objectionable. The logical implication of the Greylag Entities' argument is that any Indonesian restructuring proceeding and composition plan offering different terms to creditors in the same class will never be recognised as a matter of Singapore public policy. That surely cannot be correct. Indeed, when pressed on this point, Mr Rajaram was unable to point to any other aspect of the PKPU Proceeding that was unfair. Indeed, he conceded that the debt of each creditor was restructured on broadly the same terms.\n123 In this regard, it is pertinent that Greylag 1446 was made an offer by Garuda Indonesia to be part of the \"Go-Forward Fleet\" arrangement but chose not to take it up. Greylag 1446 then suggested an alternative lease arrangement, which was eventually not accepted by Garuda Indonesia. In our view, had Garuda Indonesia accepted that alternative lease arrangement, it is unlikely that the Greylag Entities would have any basis for complaining or that Greylag 1446 would have pursued OA 5. This fortifies the point that the crux of the Greylag Entities' complaint is not so much one of unfair treatment. It was rather about Garuda Indonesia's commercial decision not to continue its relationship with the Greylag Entities on the Greylag Entities' terms.\n124 We are also of the view that there is no merit in the point made by the Greylag Entities as regards the transparency and openness of the PKPU Proceeding. The terms of the Composition Plan were made known to all aircraft lessor creditors. This was not denied by the Greylag Entities. Indeed, the administrators of Garuda Indonesia had published and made available the relevant information in a data room which was set up for the creditors. And as the Greylag Entities' own Indonesian law expert accepts, it is possible for debtors to negotiate with creditors as to the terms of repayment and compromise, as long as the final results of the negotiations are distributed to all creditors for their review. There is therefore no issue regarding the transparency and openness of the PKPU Proceeding.\n125 For these reasons, we disagree with the Greylag Entities that the PKPU Proceeding discloses unfair treatment of creditors contrary to Singapore public policy.\nThe alleged lack of financial disclosure\nThe Greylag Entities' submissions\n126 The second point raised by the Greylag Entities relates to the allegedly inadequate disclosure of information during the PKPU Proceeding.\n127 The Greylag Entities submit that the financial status of the subsidiaries (in terms of their assets and liabilities) was opaque to the creditors throughout the PKPU Proceeding. This significantly compromised the unsecured creditors' rights to vote on the Composition Plan. This point is relevant to the Requested Documents sought in SUM 34. The allegation is that consolidated financial statements for the entire corporate group were provided to the creditors as a result of which Garuda Indonesia did not provide adequate financial information regarding Garuda France's financial position. It was important for such information to be made available as Garuda France's debts were also being released under the Composition Plan, pursuant to the Third-Party Release Provisions. The Greylag Entities say that procuring such a release without adequate disclosure of information is another aspect of the PKPU Proceeding that was contrary to Singapore public policy.\n128 In support of its position that the release of third-party debts in the absence of adequate financial disclosure is contrary to Singapore public policy, the Greylag Entities rely on the Court of Appeal's decision in Pathfinder.\n129 Accordingly, the Greylag Entities submit that third-party releases in a restructuring plan would only be upheld if sufficient information was disclosed to ensure that the creditors could exercise their voting rights meaningfully.\nNo inadequate financial disclosure amounting to a breach of public policy\n130 We do not accept the Greylag Entities' submission. We note at the outset that the factual basis for this allegation was not advanced by the Greylag Entities in the affidavit of one Mr Sean Hernon, the Greylag Entities' director. This argument was advanced for the first time in their written submissions, and Mr Rajaram conceded as much at the oral hearing.\n131 In any event, we do not think the Greylag Entities' complaint on this ground is sustainable. While we accept that the adequacy of disclosure of information in restructuring or insolvency proceedings is an important aspect of due process, nothing in the evidence before us shows that the Greylag Entities were not afforded access to such information. To the contrary, the Applicants' evidence is that Garuda Indonesia had kept its creditors updated on discussions relating to the restructuring. On 12 November 2021, Garuda Indonesia had circulated to its creditors a restructuring term sheet detailing the key commercial terms of the plan. On 17 November 2021, following negotiations and comments by its creditors, Garuda Indonesia circulated a revised version of the restructuring term sheet. And as mentioned at [124] above, a virtual data room was set up and various revised versions of the restructuring term sheet were uploaded.\n132 In relation to the Greylag Entities' allegation that Garuda France's financial information was not disclosed, the Greylag Entities do not allege that their request for such information was denied. Indeed, no attempt was made on their part to request for such information from Garuda Indonesia's administrators . Having not done so, it is impermissible for Greylag Entities to allege that they were denied such information.\n133 To our minds, therefore, there simply is no basis for alleging that the Greylag Entities were denied due process as a result of an alleged lack of financial disclosure. We therefore do not accept the Greylag Entities' submission.\nAdditional observations relating to the Public Policy Objection\n134 It is important to make two additional observations that speaks to the merits or the absence thereof of the allegations raised by the Greylag Entities under the Public Policy Objection.\n135 First, the Greylag Entities have not explained why these complaints were not raised in the PKPU Proceeding or any application or appeals therefrom. In this regard, we note Mr Rajaram's concession that the alleged impropriety of third-party releases in the Composition Plan under Indonesian law should have been raised before the Indonesian courts. Having not done that, it is impermissible for the Greylag Entities to raise in these proceedings a point of substantive law under Indonesian law.\n136 Second, it is important to note that despite the Greylag Entities claim that 74 out of 120 aircraft lessors had their rights vis-\u00e0-vis Garuda France extinguished under the Composition Plan, the plan was nevertheless supported by an overwhelming majority of creditors. While certainly not determinative, to our minds, it does suggest that contrary to the Greylag Entities' complaints, most of Garuda Indonesia's creditors did not think that the terms of the Composition Plan were unfair and prejudicial to them. Otherwise, they would likely have voted against the plan. This puts a critical dent in the Greylag Entities' argument that the absence of any requirement under Indonesian insolvency law to classify creditors appropriately or the alleged absence of transparency in Garuda Indonesia's private negotiations with selected creditors was unfair and prejudicial to the treatment of creditors and offends Singapore public policy.\n137 For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the Public Policy Objection raised by the Greylag Entities. Accordingly, we grant recognition of the PKPU Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding under Article 17 of the Third Schedule. We turn next to consider the Relief Issue.\nThe Relief Issue\n138 The next pertinent issue is whether recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan as a foreign order may be granted. This is the principal relief sought by Garuda Indonesia in OA 5. Specifically, two issues arise for our consideration:\n(a) First, whether relief may be granted under the Third Schedule in the form of recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency judgments or orders and if so, the provision under the Third Schedule that is applicable.\n(b) Second, the appropriate terms of the order giving effect to the recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan as a foreign order.\nRecognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan\nGrant of relief under Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule\n139 It is not disputed by the parties that the appropriate provision empowering the Singapore court to grant additional relief in support of the recognition of a foreign proceeding is found under Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule. It is also not disputed that upon the recognition of the PKPU Proceeding as a \"foreign main proceeding\" within the meaning of Article 17(2) of the Third Schedule, the court is empowered to grant recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan under Article 21(1).\n140 In this connection, we note that whether Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule permits the recognition and enforcement of a foreign insolvency order (including a court order sanctioning a restructuring plan) is an issue that has received diverging treatment. In a cross-jurisdictional analysis undertaken by Aedit Abdullah J in ReTantleff, Alan [2023] 3 SLR 250 (\" Tantleff \"), it was observed (at [71]-[75]) that whereas US bankruptcy law permits the recognition of foreign insolvency orders and judgments confirming foreign reorganisation plans under \u00a7 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code (the equivalent of Article 21 of the Third Schedule), this was not the case in the UK under Article 21 of the CBIR 2006. In the landmark decision of the UK Supreme Court in Rubin vEurofinance SA[2012] 3 WLR 1019 (\" Rubin (UKSC) \"), the court held (at [143]-[144]) that \"the Model Law is not designed to provide for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments\" and that Article 21 was \"concerned with procedural matters\" only.\n141 Abdullah J expressed preference for the position under US bankruptcy law for the following reasons (see Tantleff at [76]-[78]):\n76 Rubin (UKSC) has not been well received: see, for example, academic critique noting that 'the Supreme Court's reasoning in respect of Article 21 is unconvincing' (A Commentary on the UNCITRAL at p 248; Principles and Practice at p 165). It is also observed that in an attempt to get around the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Rubin (UKSC) , the UNCITRAL Working Group V drafted a proposed model law to allow for the recognition of foreign insolvency judgments, especially if the judgment comes from the jurisdiction of the debtor's COMI (Neil Hannan, Cross-Border Insolvency: The Enactment and Interpretation of the UNCITRAL Model Law (Springer, 2017) at p 244).\n77 ... The Singapore Ministry of Law has expressed its preference for the US approach in relation to Art 21(1)(g) over the UK approach. In the draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 that the Ministry of Law sought public consultation on, the draft Art 21(1)(g) of the Model Law provided that the reliefs available included 'any additional relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder under the law of Singapore ' [emphasis added]. However, in the final version of the Model Law, the italicised phrase was deleted. This was intentionally done in order to align the Singapore position with that of the US, rather than the UK, as observed from the Ministry's Response to Feedback from Public Consultation on the Draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring ...\nThe language of the Model Law as enacted in Singapore (the 'Singapore Model Law') is distinct from that of the UK Model Law, as it removes the qualifier that the relief granted must be available 'under the laws of [the State]'. From the above passage, it is clear that the Ministry of Law was concerned with the 'scope of relief that may be granted' under Art 21(1)(g) of the Singapore Model Law, and has expressly chosen to align the language of the provision with that under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.\n78 In the circumstances, the US approach should be preferred and it is the US jurisprudence which should be persuasive in determining the scope of relief to be granted. The holding in Rubin (UKSC) is not endorsed in Singapore and I decline to follow the English authorities that depart from the US position. I accept the Applicant's arguments that the Singapore court is empowered under Art 21(1)(g) of the Model Law to grant recognition of the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order as foreign orders, following the proposition found in the US authorities. I do not consider that the difference in the language of the enacting provisions in the US and Singapore makes a substantial difference. While \u00a71521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code contains the additional phrase 'to effectuate the purpose of this chapter' (see above at [71]), the difference is not material. This is because the purpose of Chapter 15 is inpari materia with the objectives stated in the preamble to our Model Law. Additionally, while the version of Art 21(1)(g) enacted in Singapore contains the modifier 'available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder' after 'any additional relief' (see above at [77]), I do not read Art 21(1)(g) to be so restricted, in line with the Ministry of Law's comments that the scope of relief that may be granted should follow the US approach and the US provisions contain a similar modifier. This also follows from the fact that the phrase 'under the law of Singapore' was eventually removed, which signifies that an expansive view is to be taken.\n[emphasis in original]\n142 We agree with Abdullah J that relief under the Third Schedule may extend to the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency orders. In so far as a contrary position is taken under English law, we also agree with Abdullah J that the position there is not persuasive. In this regard, we note in the Ministry of Law's Response to Feedback from Public Consultation on the Draft Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring, the preference expressed was to align the position under Singapore law with that under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code (at paras 11.2.1-11.2.2). We reproduce the response as follows:\n11.2 Art 21: Relief that May Be Granted Upon Recognition of a Foreign Proceeding\n11.2.1 In respect of Art 21(1)(g), we received a comment that despite similar wording in their respective provisions, the UK and US differ in their approaches on the scope of relief that may be granted. It was therefore suggested that Singapore should signal whether the US or UK approach should be adopted in respect of relief that may be granted under Art 21(1)(g).\n11.2.2 After consideration of this issue, the suggestion has been noted and accepted. Thus, this provision has been amended to align the wording with the US provision in Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.\nWe consider these views to be helpful as far as they assist us with understanding the intention behind the enactment of Article 21 of the Third Schedule.\n143 There is therefore little doubt that the Composition Plan may be recognised and enforced in Singapore as a foreign order. The issue that arises, however, is the proper basis for recognition and enforcement, namely whether it ought to be granted under the chapeau of Article 21(1) (ie , under the limb of \"any appropriate relief\") or under Article 21(1)(g). For ease of reference, we reproduce Article 21 of the Third Schedule as follows:\nArticle 21. Relief that may be granted upon recognition of a foreign proceeding\n1. Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether a foreign main proceeding or a foreign non-main proceeding, where necessary to protect the property of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, the Court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief, including -\n(g) granting any additional relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder, including any relief provided under section 96(4) of [the IRDA].\n144 Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule provides that upon the recognition of a foreign proceeding, the court may grant \"any appropriate relief\" requested by the foreign representative. Moreover, the list of reliefs under Article 21 is non-exhaustive in nature and the court is not restricted unnecessarily in its ability to grant any type of relief that is required by the circumstances of the case: see Tantleff at [68]. This view is also supported by the 2013 Guide , which states (at paras 189 and 191) that:\n189 ... [t]he types of relief listed in article 21, paragraph 1, are typical of the relief most frequently granted in insolvency proceedings; however, the list is notexhaustive and the court is not restricted unnecessarily in its ability to grant any type of relief that is available under the law of the enacting State and needed in the circumstances of the case .\n191 It is in the nature of discretionary relief that the court may tailor it to the case at hand. ...\n[emphasis added]\n145 Where relief in the form of the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency judgments and orders is sought, we are of the view that the relevant provision is \"grant any appropriate relief\" found in the chapeau of Article 21(1), and not Article 21(1)(g) of the Third Schedule. To the extent that Abdullah J in Tantleff held that Article 21(1)(g) is the exclusive provision, therefore, we respectfully disagree. We say that the chapeau of Article 21(1) is the appropriate provision for the following reasons.\n146 First, the recognition and enforcement of a foreign restructuring plan and a foreign court order is clearly not \"relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder\" within the meaning of Article 21(1)(g) of the Third Schedule. Nothing in the IRDA confers on Singapore insolvency officeholders the power to apply for the recognition and enforcement of such plans and orders.\n147 Second, and as Abdullah J observed in Tantleff (at [79]), \"[i]nvoking [the chapeau of Article 21 of the Third Schedule] would circumvent the issue that the enforcement of a foreign rehabilitation plan is not ordinarily 'relief that may be available to a Singapore insolvency officeholder' under Art 21(1)(g) of the Model Law\". Thus, it does appear that Abdullah J harboured some genuine doubt expressed over the propriety of invoking Article 21(1)(g) of the Third Schedule in this manner.\n148 Third, the position under US bankruptcy law is that recognition and enforcement of foreign court orders may be granted under the chapeau of \u00a7 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code, which reads:\n\u00a71521. Relief that may be granted upon recognition\n(a) Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether main or nonmain, where necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and to protect the assets of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief , ...\n[emphasis added]\n149 We agree with the approach adopted in the US jurisprudence, which supports the view that the better approach is to recognise a foreign order under the chapeau of Article 21 of the Third Schedule. Thus, in Inre Lupatech SA 611 BR 496, 502 (Bankr SDNY 2020), the SDNY held that \"appropriate relief\" under \u00a7 1521 of the US Bankruptcy Code includes \"enforcing a foreign order confirming a debtor's plan\", but that the relief will only be granted if the interests of the creditors and other interested entities are sufficiently protected. Likewise, the SDNY held in Inre CGG SA 579 BR 716, 720 (Bankr SDNY 2017) that \"the recognition and enforcement of the Sanctioning Order [ie , the foreign court order confirming the restructuring plan] is ' appropriate relief ' under section 1521(a) of the Bankruptcy Code\" [emphasis added]. The reference to the language of \"appropriate relief\" under the chapeau of \u00a7 1521 of the US Bankruptcy Code (rather than the language of \"additional relief\" under \u00a7 1521(a)(7), the equivalent of Article 21(1)(g) of the Third Schedule) was also made in the case of In reMetrofinanciera Lexis 6541 (Bankr SD Tex 2010) (at [11]), when deciding whether to recognise an order confirming a pre-packaged plan of reorganisation. In In re Cell C Proprietary Ltd 571 BR 542, 554 (Bankr SDNY 2017), the SDNY explained that the reason why the recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency court orders and judgments fell within the wording of \"appropriate relief\" in the chapeau of \u00a7 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code, was because this relief was not one enumerated in the non-exhaustive list set out in \u00a7 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code (which would include \u00a7 1521(a)(7)).\n150 We conclude this issue with one final observation. We note that Abdullah J in Tantleff had justified the view that recognition and enforcement of a foreign insolvency judgment or order may proceed under Article 21(1)(g) of the Third Schedule as this was the position taken by the SDNY in Inre Oi SA 587 BR 253 (Bankr SDNY 2018) (\" Oi SA \") (albeit under \u00a7 1521(a)(7) of the US Bankruptcy Code). We do not think this authority is persuasive for the view that recognition and enforcement of a foreign court order and plan is appropriately granted under \u00a7 1521(a)(7) as opposed to the chapeau of \u00a7 1521(a) of the US Bankruptcy Code. No reasons were given by the SDNY in Oi SA save that \"it is the type of relief that was available under former Section 304 and routinely granted under U.S. law\": see Oi SA at 266. In arriving at this proposition, the SDNY relied on its previous decision in Inre Rede Energia S.A. , 515 BR 69 (\" RedeEnergia \") (at 92-93), where the court enforced a Brazilian reorganisation plan under \u00a7 1521 of the US Bankruptcy Code. On closer inspection, however, it appears that the SDNY in RedeEnergia had granted recognition and enforcement under the chapeau of \u00a7 1521(a) and not \u00a7 1521(a)(7). We note also that the position taken in Oi SA constitutes a minority of US authorities which permitted recognition and enforcement under \u00a7 1521(a)(7) as opposed to the chapeau of \u00a7 1521(a).\n151 For these reasons, we think the correct approach is for recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan to be granted under the chapeau in Article 21(1) of the Third Schedule as part of \"any appropriate relief\" requested by the foreign representative.\nThe appropriate terms for the order recognising the PKPU Proceeding and Composition Plan\n152 We turn finally to consider the appropriate terms of the order granting recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan.\n153 At the outset, we note that although Article 21 of the Third Schedule appears to give the courts broad latitude to mould relief in aid of a foreign insolvency proceeding, that is not quite the case. Rather, we agree with Abdullah J's observations in Tantleff that where relief is granted (such as in the form of recognition and enforcement of a foreign insolvency order), the court \"is not merely acting as a rubber stamp\": see Tantleff at [81]. To this end, Article 22(1) of the Third Schedule states as follows:\nIn granting or denying relief under Article 19 or 21, or in modifying or terminating relief under paragraph 3 of this Article or Article 20(6), the Court must be satisfied that the interests of the creditors (including any secured creditors or parties to hire-purchase agreements (as defined in section 88(1) of this Act)) and other interested persons, including if appropriate the debtor, are adequately protected.\n154 Although the parties in the present case do not raise any arguments on creditor protection (or the lack thereof) in relation to the reliefs sought by Garuda Indonesia, we think it pertinent to emphasise that the court must, in determining the appropriate relief, bear in mind the need to ensure that the interests of creditors and other interested persons are protected. In this connection, any relief sought by a foreign representative must not impinge excessively on any one entity's interests. Indeed, relief will only be granted if the court is satisfied that the interests of the relevant persons are protected. In the words of the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (\"the Fourth Circuit\") in Jaffe v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. 737 F.3d 14 (4th Cir 2013) (\" Jaffe \"), an application for recognition and relief sought under the Model Law \"does not require a court, in considering a foreign representative's request for discretionary relief under [Article 21 of the Third Schedule], to blind itself\" to the detriment that the relief sought may potentially impact others: see Jaffe at 29.\n155 We agree, and we note that a balancing inquiry was also alluded to in the 2013 Guide (at para 196):\nThe idea underlying article 22 is that there should be a balance between relief that may be granted to the foreign representative and the interests of the persons that may be affected by such relief. This balance is essential to achieve the objectives of cross-border insolvency legislation.\n156 In the present case, we are satisfied that the interests of Garuda Indonesia, its creditors and other stakeholders are sufficiently protected under the Composition Plan. An order enforcing the Composition Plan will permit the Applicants to take the actions necessary to implement the terms of the plan in Singapore. Absent the grant of recognition and enforcement, the terms of the Composition Plan may not be fully implemented as contemplated by the parties who have voted in favour of and have given their support to the plan. This can only work to the detriment of all creditors and stakeholders involved in Garuda Indonesia's restructuring as a collective whole.\n157 We turn next to consider the reliefs sought by the Applicants in the present case (see [2] above). In our view, there is nothing to suggest that the reliefs sought by the Applicants are inappropriate or not permitted as a matter of law. In granting the reliefs sought by the Applicants, however, we think it necessary to make further qualifications to the terms of the orders for the relief. In this connection, we note that Article 22(2) of the Third Schedule empowers the courts to grant the relief sought under Article 21 subject to conditions that the court considers appropriate.\n158 In OA 5, we note there are two ongoing arbitration proceedings involving the Greylag Entities as claimants, and both Garuda Indonesia and Garuda France as respondents. Given that the PKPU Proceeding is recognised in Singapore as a foreign main proceeding, Article 20(1)(a) of the Third Schedule operates to stay those arbitration proceedings as regards Garuda Indonesia. As Garuda France is not a party to the PKPU Proceeding, the automatic stay under Article 20(1)(a) does not apply to the arbitration proceedings against Garuda France and we do not understand the parties as contending otherwise.\n159 The issue that arises for our consideration, however, is the effect that recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan would have on the arbitration proceedings between Garuda France and the Greylag Entities, in particular whether Garuda France may rely on the Composition Plan and the purported release of its debt obligations therein as a defence against the Greylag Entities' claims which appear to be premised on the same debt obligations. In this regard, Mr Chua submits that the effect the Composition Plan has on the claims raised in the arbitration is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine, and it is not necessary for us to make an express order regarding the legal effect of recognising the Composition Plan on the claims in other proceedings (which we term the \"carve-out\"). While we generally agree with that submission, our difficulty with not including an appropriate carve-out in the recognition and enforcement order relates to the uncertainty in the extent to which recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan in Singapore may have over the conduct of the arbitration (which we note is seated in Singapore) and the determination of the issues therein. This is especially since the Composition Plan appears to have the effect of releasing Garuda France's debt liability owed to the Greylag Entities under the Aircraft Leases.\n160 In this connection, Mr Rajaram accepts that the Composition Plan can only be enforced by the parties who are bound by the plan, and it is common ground between the parties that Garuda France is not one such party. This position is also accepted by the parties' Indonesian law experts. Be that as it may, in so far as the release of the debts of Garuda France under the Composition Plan may have an impact on the issues arising from the claims against Garuda France in the arbitration proceedings, that is a matter more appropriately dealt with in those proceedings.\n161 We therefore think it appropriate to make the following carve-out in respect of the recognition and enforcement of the Composition Plan:\nThe Homologation Order by the Jakarta Commercial Court and the Composition Plan will be recognised and enforced in Singapore. Such recognition and enforcement will be without prejudice to any ongoing arbitration or litigation proceedings involving the Greylag Entities and Garuda France or any other subsidiaries of Garuda Indonesia within the jurisdiction of Singapore or where Singapore is the seat of the arbitration, as the case may be.\n162 Finally, we add that the parties' Indonesian law experts agree that Indonesian law recognises a creditor's right to pursue a claim for debt rejected at the proof-of-debt stage in a PKPU proceeding in a separate forum. As this forms one of the claims pursued by the Greylag Entities against Garuda France in the arbitration, we think it appropriate to make the following carve-out regarding the scope of the stay of proceedings imposed pursuant to Article 20 of the Third Schedule:\nThe parties agree that the stay of proceedings under Article 20 of the Third Schedule will not extend to include claims pursued by the Greylag Entities against Garuda Indonesia in arbitration in relation to the portion of the Greylag Entities' debt that was not admitted by Garuda Indonesia's administrators during the PKPU Proceedings.\nConclusion\n163 For the reasons above, we allow OA 5 and recognise the PKPU Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, and grant relief for: (a) all legal proceedings between Garuda Indonesia and the Greylag Entities to be stayed pursuant to the mandatory stay under Article 20(1) of the Third Schedule; and (b) the Composition Plan to be recognised and enforced in Singapore under the chapeau to Article 21(1) (ie , under the limb of \"any appropriate relief\") of the Third Schedule as a foreign order subject to the terms which we have set out above.",

and\n(b) such other processes in relation to the life policy as the\nAuthority may prescribe.\".\nSavings and transitional provision\n4. For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any\nprovision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such additional provisions of a savings or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that provision as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Insurance Act (Cap. 142) \u2014\n(a) to regulate the payment of any remuneration by licensed insurers to licensed financial advisers, exempt financial advisers and their representatives and supervisors in relation to the provision of certain financial advisory services or sale of life policies;\n(b) to make provision for the maintenance of the Monetary Authority of\nSingapore's (the Authority) web aggregator; and\n(c) to enable the Authority to direct licensed insurers to manufacture and offer such type of life policy in Singapore, as may be prescribed by the\nAuthority.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 inserts a new section 26.\nThe new section 26(1) prohibits the payment of any remuneration by a licensed insurer to a licensed financial adviser, an exempt financial adviser, a representative or a supervisor of a licensed financial adviser or an exempt financial adviser in relation to \u2014\n(a) the provision of any financial advisory service in connection with any life policy; or\n(b) the sale of any life policy.\nThe Authority may by regulations prescribe the exceptions to this prohibition and, in doing so, the Authority may specify how the payment of remuneration is to be made. For instance, the Authority may require the payment to be spread over a period of time to prevent \"frontloading\" of remuneration.\nA licensed insurer must comply with the new section 26(1) despite any other duty imposed on it by any other rule of law, written law or agreement or arrangement. In complying with the new section 26(1), the licensed insurer is treated as not being in breach of any such rule of law or written law, or such agreement or arrangement entered into before the commencement of the new section 26.\nAny person who fails to comply with the new section 26(1) is guilty of an offence.\nAwritten notice issued under the new section 26 and new sections 33A and 33C need not be published in the Gazette by virtue of the definition of \"directions\" in section 1A read with section 64(3) of the Act.\nClause 3 inserts new sections 33A, 33B and 33C.\nThe new section 33A empowers the Authority to require any licensed insurer to furnish to the Authority with such information as the Authority may require for the purposes of the web aggregator established by the Authority for the purpose of assisting any person in the purchase of a policy.\nThe Authority has the discretion to publish the information furnished on the web aggregator.\nAny licensed insurer which \u2014\n(a) furnishes any information, which is false or misleading in a material particular, to the Authority; or\n(b) fails to take reasonable care that any information furnished to the\nAuthority is accurate, is guilty of an offence.\nThe new section 33B requires every licensed insurer to pay to the Authority certain fees with respect to the operation, development, maintenance or use of the web aggregator.\nThe Authority may prescribe different fees for different licensed insurers or classes of licensed insurers, and any fees prescribed need not bear any relationship to the costs of the services provided by the Authority in relation to the web aggregator.\nThe total fees payable by all the licensed insurers to the Authority for any period of 12 months, or a shorter period, must not exceed the cap referred to in the new section 33B(3).\nThe Authority has the power to waive, refund or remit the whole or any part of the fees paid or payable under the new section 33B. The Authority also has the power to impose a late payment fee on any licensed insurer which is late in paying the fees. Both fees are recoverable by the Authority as a judgment debt.\nThe new section 33C enables the Authority to direct a licensed insurer to manufacture and offer such type of life policy in Singapore as the Authority may prescribe or specify by written notice, if the Authority is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so.\nAny licensed insurer which fails to comply with the direction is guilty of an offence.\nClause 4 gives the Minister power to make regulations of a savings and transitional nature.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

        "text": "Published by Authority\nNO. 1]\nY, JANUARY 6\n[2020\nNotification No. B 1 \u2013\u2013 The\nMerchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Amendment) Bill is published for general information. It was introduced in\nParliament on 6 January 2020.\nMerchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Amendment) Bill\nBill No. 1/2020.\nRead the first time on 6 January 2020.\nA BILL i n t i t u l e d\nAn Act to amend the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour\nConvention) Act 2014 (Act 6 of 2014).\nBe it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the\nParliament of Singapore, as follows:\nShort title and commencement\n1. This\nAct is the\nMerchant\nShipping (Maritime\nLabour\nConvention) (Amendment) Act 2020 and comes into operation on a date that the Minister appoints by notification in the Gazette.\nAmendment of section 2\n2. Section 2(1) of the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour\nConvention) Act 2014 (called in this Act the principal Act) is amended \u2014\n(a) by inserting, immediately before the definition of\n\"Authority\", the following definition:\n\" \"armed robbery\", in relation to a ship, means \u2014\n(a) any illegal act of violence or detention or any act of depredation, or threat of such act, other than an act\nof piracy, committed for private ends and directed against the ship or against persons or property on board the ship, within a State's internal waters, archipelagic waters and\nterritorial sea; or\n(b) any act of inciting or intentionally facilitating an act mentioned in paragraph (a);\"; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after the definition of \"other\nrelevant written law\", the following definition:\n\" \"piracy\" has the same meaning as in the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted on 10 December 1982 by the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the\nSea;\".\nAmendment of section 14\n3. Section 14 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (12), the following subsection:\n\"(12A) Despite subsections (9) and (12) or any term of the seafarer's employment agreement, where a seafarer is held captive on or off a ship as a result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship, the seafarer's employment agreement\ncontinues to have effect during the period of captivity, regardless of whether \u2014\n(a) the date fixed for the expiry of the seafarer's employment agreement has passed; or\n(b) either party to the seafarer's employment agreement\nhas given notice to suspend or terminate it.\".\nAmendment of section 20\n4. Section 20 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (7), the following subsection:\n\"(7A) Where a seafarer is held captive on or off a ship as a\nresult of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship, the seafarer's wages and other entitlements (including the remittance of any allotments made in accordance with section 21) under \u2014\n(a) the seafarer's employment agreement;\n(b) any applicable collective agreement; or\n(c) any written law, must continue to be paid during the entire period of captivity and until \u2014\n(d) the date on which the seafarer is released and duly\nrepatriated in accordance with this Act; or\n(e) the date of the seafarer's death, if the seafarer dies while in captivity.\".\nAmendment of section 23\n5. Section 23(2) of the principal Act is amended by deleting the\nfull-stop at the end of paragraph (d) and substituting a semi-colon, and by inserting immediately thereafter the following paragraph:\n\"(e) where the seafarer is released from captivity after being held captive on or off a ship as a result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship.\".\nAmendment of section 34\n6. Section 34 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (3), the following subsection:\n\"(3A) Where an approved financial security provider has made any payment to a seafarer under a contract of insurance or other financial security mentioned in subsection (2) for a\nliability arising from a shipowner's obligation to repatriate a seafarer, any right which the seafarer has (or but for that payment would have had) against the shipowner as a result of the liability is, with respect to the amount of payment made, transferred to and vested in the approved financial security\nprovider.\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention)\nAct 2014 (Act 6 of 2014) \u2014\n(a) to enable Singapore to give effect to the Amendments of 2018 to the\nMaritime Labour Convention, 2006, approved by the International\nLabour Organization at the 107th Session of the International Labour\nConference in Geneva on 5 June 2018 (the 2018 Amendments to the\nConvention); and\n(b) to facilitate, where an approved financial security provider has paid a seafarer under a contract of insurance or other financial security for certain liabilities owed by a shipowner to the seafarer, the transfer to and vesting in the approved financial security provider of any right that the seafarer has in respect of the liability.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 inserts new definitions for \"armed robbery\" and \"piracy\" in section 2(1).\nThe definition of \"armed robbery\" is based on the definition of \"armed robbery against ships\" in the new paragraph 7(b) of Standard A2.1 inserted by the 2018 Amendments to the Convention.\nThe definition of \"piracy\" is based on the definition in the new paragraph 7(a) of Standard A2.1 inserted by the 2018 Amendments to the Convention. The term \"piracy\" has the same meaning as in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) adopted on 10 December 1982 by the Third United Nations\nConference on the Law of the Sea.\nClause 3 inserts a new section 14(12A) to provide that where a seafarer is held captive on or off a ship as a result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship, the seafarer's employment agreement continues to have effect during the period of captivity. This is regardless of whether the date fixed for the expiry of the seafarer's employment agreement has passed or either party to the seafarer's employment agreement has given notice to suspend or terminate it.\nClause 4 inserts a new section 20(7A) to provide that where a seafarer is held captive on or off a ship as a result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship, the seafarer's wages and other entitlements (including the remittance of any allotments made in accordance with section 21) under the seafarer's employment agreement, any applicable collective agreement or any written law, must continue to be paid during the seafarer's period of captivity. This obligation continues until the date on which the seafarer is released and duly repatriated in accordance with the Act or the date of the seafarer's death, if the seafarer dies while in captivity.\nClause 5 inserts a new section 23(2)(e) to provide that a seafarer employed on a ship who is held captive on or off the ship as a result of an act of piracy or armed robbery against the ship is entitled to repatriation upon his or her release from that captivity. This ensures that a seafarer's entitlement to repatriation does not lapse during the period of the seafarer's captivity.\nClause 6 inserts a new section 34(3A). Currently, an approved financial security provider who has entered into a contract mentioned in section 34(2) may under the common law acquire certain rights of a seafarer against a shipowner where it has paid the seafarer under the contract for a liability of the shipowner, for example by subrogation or assignment. However, an approved financial security provider would need to take certain steps in order to do so. The new subsection (3A) facilitates the transfer to and vesting of a seafarer's rights in an approved financial security provider, by providing the approved financial security provider with a statutory basis, in addition to its rights under the common law.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

It also makes related amendments to the Stamp Duties Act (Cap. 312).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends the definition of \"Comptroller\" in section 2 (Interpretation) so that, for the purpose of compounding an offence under section 34F(8), the reference to \"Comptroller\" in section 34F(9) does not include a Deputy\nComptroller or an Assistant Comptroller.\nClause 3 amends section 10B (Profits of unit trusts) to provide that no unit trust may be approved under that section after 18 February 2019.\nClause 4 amends section 10F (Ascertainment of income from certain public-private partnership arrangements). The section provides that a person providing FRS 115 construction or upgrade services to the Government or an approved statutory body under a public-private partnership arrangement to which the financial reporting standard INT FRS 112 or SFRS(I) INT 12 applies, has a right to elect for any amount that is treated as income from such services under that financial reporting standard, to be treated as having been derived in the basis period in which those services are completed. The amendment extends this treatment to SFRS(I) 15 construction or upgrade services.\nClause 5 amends section 12 (Sources of income) to provide an exception to subsection (7). Subsection (7) provides (among other matters) that rent for the use of movable property that is borne by a person resident in Singapore or a permanent establishment in Singapore, or is deductible against income accruing in or derived from Singapore, is deemed as derived from Singapore and chargeable to tax. The amendment disapplies this provision to rent that is paid for the use outside\nSingapore of any tangible movable property, where \u2014\n(a) the use is connected with the purpose of an overseas trip undertaken for a trade, business, profession or vocation carried on in Singapore by a person resident in Singapore, or carried on through a permanent establishment in Singapore; or\n(b) the use is connected with the maintenance of a representative office outside Singapore for the purpose of a trade, business, profession or vocation carried on in Singapore.\nAn example of property that is tangible movable property is a vehicle. An example of property that is not tangible movable property is intellectual property.\nClause 6 amends section 13 (Exempt income) for the following purposes:\n(a) to delete the words \"on or before 31 March 2020\" in subsection (1)(zh) so that any distribution from a real estate investment trust (REIT) made out of income that is subject to tax transparency under section 43, to an individual unit holder is (with some exceptions) exempt from tax under that provision, regardless of the date of distribution;\n(b) to delete the words \"during the period from 1 July 2018 to 31 March 2020 (both dates inclusive)\" in subsection (1)(zs) so that any distribution from a REIT exchange-traded fund that is approved for\nthe purposes of section 43(2), out of income that is subject to tax transparency under section 43, to an individual unit holder is (with some exceptions) exempt from tax under that provision, regardless of the date of distribution;\n(c) to extend the date on or after which orders made under subsection (12) are to operate in the manner set out in subsections (12A) and (12B), to\n1 January 2026. Subsections (12A) and (12B) provide that orders made under subsection (12) which exempt from tax income received by the trustee of a REIT or a wholly owned subsidiary of a REIT, continue to have effect on or after the stated date only in relation to income received in Singapore that is paid out of income or gains relating to immovable property outside Singapore and acquired before that date, and derived at a time when the trustee or subsidiary beneficially owns the property, or from the disposal of the property;\n(d) to grant exemption from tax of certain income derived from debt securities commonly known as insurance-linked securities, if at least 20% of the costs incurred in relation to the issue of the securities are required to be paid to persons or partnerships that carry on any business, trade or profession in Singapore.\nClause 7 amends section 13A (Exemption of shipping profits) which provides for certain income of a shipping enterprise to be exempt from tax under that section. The amendment provides that the tax exemption applies to income derived on or after 12 December 2018 by a shipping enterprise from the finance leasing of a Singapore ship, including any such income derived from foreign exchange and risk management activities that are carried out in connection with or incidental to the finance lease. The clause also makes consequential amendments to the definition of \"finance leasing\" in that section.\nClause 8 amends section 13CA (Exemption of income of prescribed persons arising from funds managed by fund manager in Singapore) to extend the date by which a company or trustee of a trust fund must be incorporated or constituted to be eligible for the tax exemption under that section, to 31 December 2024.\nClause 9 amends section 13F (Exemption of international shipping profits) which provides for certain income of an approved international shipping enterprise to be exempt from tax under that section. The amendment provides that the following income derived on or after 12 December 2018 by an approved international shipping enterprise is exempt from tax:\n(a) the finance leasing of any foreign ship to any person where the ship is used by that person for the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods outside the limits of the port of Singapore;\n(b) the finance leasing of any foreign dredger, foreign seismic ship, or any foreign ship used for offshore oil or gas activity to any person for such use outside the limits of the port of Singapore;\n(c) the finance leasing of any foreign ship to any person where the ship is used by the person for towage and salvage operations outside the limits of the port of Singapore;\n(d) the finance leasing of any foreign ship for offshore renewable energy activity or offshore mineral activity to any person, for the person's operation outside the limits of the port of Singapore;\n(e) foreign exchange or risk management activities in connection with and incidental to an activity mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d).\nClause 10 amends section 13G (Exemption of income of foreign trust) to extend the date by which a foreign trust or eligible holding company is to be constituted or incorporated for certain of its income to be exempt from tax under the section and, in relation to a trust or company that is constituted or incorporated before that date, to prescribe a later basis period in which certain conditions are to be satisfied for such exemption to apply.\nClause 11 amends section 13H (Exemption of income of venture company) to amend subsection (2C) to remove any doubt that the Minister or such person as the\nMinister may appoint may impose conditions in granting approval for tax exemption under the section. The clause also deletes the definition of \"approved\" in subsection (18) as it is not necessary.\nClause 12 amends section 13N (Exemption of tax on income derived by non-ordinarily resident individual) to provide for the phasing-out of the Not\nOrdinarily Resident (NOR) Scheme. The last consecutive 5-year period for which an NOR status may be granted to an individual under that section is the period from the year of assessment 2020 to the year of assessment 2024. An application for the NOR status must be made before 1 January 2025, and the last year of assessment which an NOR individual may elect for the tax exemption to apply under that section is the year of assessment 2024.\nClause 13 amends section 13O (Exemption of income of foreign account of philanthropic purpose trust) \u2014\n(a) to extend the date by which a philanthropic purpose trust or an eligible holding company is to be constituted or incorporated for certain of its income to be exempt from tax under the section and, in relation to a trust or company that is constituted or incorporated before that date, to prescribe a later basis period in which certain conditions are to be satisfied for such exemption to apply; and\n(b) to modify the requirements to be satisfied by a corporate settlor of an account of a philanthropic purpose trust for income from such account\nto be exempt from tax for the year of assessment 2021 onwards, as follows:\n(i) the settlor must not carry on a business in or outside of\nSingapore (and not just in Singapore) in the basis period for the year of assessment;\n(ii) the settlor must not have 20% or more of the total number of its issued shares beneficially owned by another company which carries on a business in or outside of Singapore (and not just in\nSingapore).\nClause 14 amends section 13Q (Exemption of relevant income of prescribed locally administered trust) to extend the date by which a locally administered trust or holding company established for the purpose of such trust, is to be constituted or incorporated for certain of its income to be exempt from tax under the section and, in relation to a trust or company that is constituted or incorporated before that date, to prescribe a later basis period in which certain conditions are to be satisfied for such exemption to apply.\nClause 15 amends section 13R (Exemption of income of company incorporated and resident in Singapore arising from funds managed by fund manager in\nSingapore) to extend the date by which a company may be approved for a tax exemption under that section, to 31 December 2024.\nClause 16 amends section 13S (Exemption of income of shipping investment enterprise) which provides (among other matters) for income derived by an approved shipping investment enterprise from the chartering or finance leasing of any sea-going ship that was acquired by the enterprise before or during the period of its approval, and income derived from foreign exchange and risk management activities in connection with and incidental to such chartering or finance leasing, to be exempt from tax under that section.\nThe amendment extends the provision by exempting from tax income derived on or after 12 December 2018 by an approved shipping investment enterprise from the chartering or finance leasing of a sea-going ship, which the enterprise had chartered, or leased under a finance lease, from an approved related party. The ship must have been acquired by the related party before or during the period of the approval of the related party. Income from foreign exchange and risk management activities connected with and incidental to such chartering or finance leasing is similarly exempt from tax.\nClause 16 further amends section 13S to provide that income of an approved shipping investment enterprise derived on or after 12 December 2018 from the chartering or finance leasing of a sea-going ship that was acquired by way of a finance lease entered into with an entity that is not an approved related party, does not qualify for tax exemption.\nClause 17 amends section 13X (Exemption of income arising from funds managed by fund manager in Singapore) \u2014\n(a) to provide that the exemption of tax under that section is also subject to the conditions of approval of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), in a case where the income to be exempt is that of an SPV;\n(b) to enable the income of an SPV of an approved master-feeder fund-SPV structure or an approved master fund-SPV structure to be approved for tax exemption under the section, even though it is not a 1st or 2nd tier SPV that is wholly owned by the master fund of the structure. To be eligible to be so approved, the net benefits of all investments held by the SPV must go to the master fund, or the master fund and certain other persons or investment vehicles. Such approval may only be given on or after 19 February 2019;\n(c) to enable an SPV that is not a company to be approved for tax exemption under the section; and\n(d) to extend the period by which approvals of persons and investment vehicles for the purpose of the tax exemption under the section may be granted.\nClause 18 amends section 13Y (Exemption of certain income of prescribed sovereign fund entity and approved foreign government-owned entity) to extend till 31 December 2024 the period in which a foreign government-owned entity may be approved for a tax exemption under that section.\nClause 19 amends section 13Z (Exemption of gains or profits from disposal of ordinary shares) which provides for tax exemption on any gains or profits derived by a company from the disposal of ordinary shares belonging to it in another company. Where the company given the exemption had in an earlier year of assessment claimed a deduction or been charged to tax for certain losses or profits attributable to the disposed shares, the amount of the losses or profits will be treated as chargeable income or allowable expenses of the company in the year of the disposal. The losses and profits include a loss and profit recognised under certain financial reporting standards. The amendment adds a reference in the latter to the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 9.\nClause 20 amends section 14V (Deduction for amortisation of intangible asset created under public-private partnership arrangement), which provides that where an intangible asset is created under a public-private partnership arrangement to which INT FRS 112 applies, and amortisation of the asset is recognised in accordance with the financial reporting standard known as FRS 38 in financial statements for a basis period for a year of assessment, then the amount of the amortisation that (in accordance with FRS 38) is recognised as an expense is an allowable deduction against an amount deemed as income for that basis period from providing services under the arrangement under the amended section 10F.\nThe amendment extends the section to an intangible asset created under a public-private partnership arrangement to which SFRS(I) INT 12 applies, and to the amortisation of such asset that is recognised under the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 1-38.\nClause 21 makes various amendments to section 14ZB (Deduction for expenditure for services or secondment to institutions of a public character), which allows an entity that incurs certain expenditure when its employees provided services to an institution of a public character by arrangement with the institution and on the instruction or request of the entity, to claim an additional deduction. The amendments are for the following purposes:\n(a) where the expenditure is salary expenditure, to allow an entity to opt for the expenditure to be computed on a fixed hourly rate to be prescribed in rules;\n(b) to allow an entity to claim such deduction irrespective of the number of working hours per week of the employee who provided the services or who was seconded;\n(c) to make an amendment to subsection (13) that was inadvertently omitted when the section was amended in 2018 extending the period during which expenditure incurred may be allowed a deduction under that section.\nClause 22 inserts a new section 14ZD to enable a resident individual who derives in a basis period commission from one or more prescribed activities that is chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(a), to claim a deduction for outgoings and expenses incurred of an amount that is determined by a prescribed formula, instead of the actual amount of such outgoings and expenses.\nThis only applies to commission income from a prescribed activity or prescribed activities in respect of which there are deductible outgoings or expenses. For example, if an individual \u2014\n(a) derived commission income from activity A, in respect of which the individual did not incur any deductible expense; and\n(b) derived commission income from activity B, in respect of which the individual incurred deductible expense, then the prescribed formula may only be applied to the commission income from activity B and is to be deducted against such income.\nThe application of the new tax treatment is subject to the following:\n(a) the gross amount of commission derived by the individual from a prescribed activity or prescribed activities in the basis period for which there are deductible outgoings and expenses must not exceed $50,000;\n(b) the individual may elect to disapply the tax treatment under the section to any such commission derived in the basis period for a particular year of assessment. If the individual carried on more than one prescribed activity, he or she may not make the election for only one or some of those activities;\n(c) the commission excludes any commission derived by the individual as a partner in a partnership.\nClause 23 amends section 19B (Writing-down allowances for intellectual property rights) to provide that, if a condition subsequent imposed for the waiver of certain requirements for the making of writing-down allowances to a company is not complied with, and the authority that waived the requirements considers that it is just and reasonable to do so, it may make a determination that the company is not entitled to any writing-down allowances in respect of the relevant intellectual property rights beginning with a specified year of assessment. Where such determination is made \u2014\n(a) any allowances already made for the specified or a subsequent year of assessment are treated as having been wrongly made to the company and an assessment may be raised to recover any tax shortfall; and\n(b) the allowances may no longer be made to the company for the capital expenditure for those intellectual property rights.\nClause 23 also amends section 19B \u2014\n(a) to provide that the period in which intellectual property rights must be acquired for writing-down allowances to be granted under subsection (1) ends on the last day of the basis period for the year of assessment 2016; and\n(b) to extend the period (till the last day of the basis period for the year of assessment 2025) in which intellectual property rights may be acquired for the grant of the writing-down allowance under subsection (1AA) on the capital expenditure incurred in such acquisition.\nClause 24 makes various amendments to section 26 (Profits of insurers) that are consequential on amendments made to the Insurance (Valuation and Capital)\nRegulations 2004 (G.N. No. S 498/2004) in 2018. The amendments are to ensure that any increase or decrease in policy liabilities of an insurer in a basis period that is deductible or taxable continues to be net of liabilities in respect of reinsurance ceded to a reinsurer.\nClause 25 amends subsection (20) of section 34C (Amalgamation of companies), which provides that no writing-down allowances under section 19B may be granted to an amalgamated company of a qualifying amalgamation in respect of intellectual property rights that are recognised under certain financial reporting standards but were not in existence prior to the\namalgamation. The amendment extends this treatment to intellectual property rights that are recognised under the financial reporting standards SFRS(I) 1-38 and SFRS(I) 3.\nClause 26 amends subsection (5) of section 34G (Modification of provisions for companies redomiciled in Singapore), which provides that where a redomiciled company incurs on or after its registration date any impairment loss from a financial asset on revenue account acquired for a trade or business outside\nSingapore before that date, it is allowed a deduction for that loss to the extent it becomes credit-impaired within the meaning of the financial reporting standard known as FRS 109. The amendment adds a reference in the latter to the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 9.\nClause 27 inserts a new section 34J which allows a recipient of a Maritime\nSector Incentive (MSI) (i.e. a company or registered business trust entitled to a tax incentive for its income under section 13A, 13F, 13S or 43ZA) that has prepared its financial accounts in accordance with the financial reporting standards known as FRS 116 or SFRS(I) 16, to elect for the tax treatment set out in the section. The tax treatment is as follows:\n(a) if, in an applicable period as defined in that section, a sublease of certain assets by the electing recipient is recognised as a finance lease in accordance with FRS 116 or SFRS(I) 16, then income derived in that period under the sublease is taken as having been derived from a finance lease for the purpose of section 10D (Income from finance or operating lease);\n(b) if, in an applicable period, a sublease of certain assets by the electing recipient is recognised as an operating lease in accordance with\nFRS 116 or SFRS(I) 16, then income derived in that period under the sublease is taken as not having been derived from a finance lease for the purpose of section 10D;\n(c) the electing recipient is not entitled to deduct any outgoing or expense incurred during an applicable period in relation to certain assets of which it is a lessee, against income derived from the use of those assets;\n(d) for a year of assessment between the year of assessment for the basis period in which the election is made, and the year of assessment before the year of assessment for the basis period in which the electing recipient ceases to be an MSI recipient (called the last year of assessment), no capital allowance, or only a pro-rated amount of such allowance, may be made to an electing recipient in respect of certain assets leased by it. Further, no balancing allowance or balancing charge may be made to or on the electing recipient for an event that\noccurs in relation to such asset in the basis period or a specified part of the basis period for any such year of assessment;\n(e) for the last year of assessment, any capital allowance to be made to an electing recipient must take into account any allowances that would have been made to the electing recipient but for paragraph (d), even though no such allowance was in fact made. The balance is then reduced by an amount that corresponds to the period between the start of the basis period and the day before the day the electing recipient ceases to be an MSI recipient. Further, no balancing allowance or charge may be made to or on the electing recipient for an event that occurs in relation to such asset in that period;\n(f) any capital allowance to be made to the electing recipient for any year of assessment after the last year of assessment must similarly take into account allowances not made in the past years of assessment;\n(g) if the tax treatment has been applied to any provisionally-registered ship and that ship subsequently fails to obtain a permanent certificate of registry, the tax treatment must be reversed for that ship and certain other assets.\nThe table below illustrates the operation of paragraphs (c) to (f) above. The illustration is based on the following:\n(a) Yis an approved international shipping enterprise whose financial year ends on 31 December;\n(b) in the year of assessment (YA) 2016, Y leased for 10 years for its trade or business a ship under a finance lease that is treated as a sale.

This includes a condition requiring the acquiring company or acquiring subsidiary to exert \"significant influence\" (within the meaning of certain financial reporting standards) over the target company. The amendment adds a reference in the latter to the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 1-28.\nClause 28 also amends section 37L to provide that, if a condition subsequent imposed for the waiver of certain requirements for allowing deductions to an acquiring company for a qualifying acquisition of shares is not complied with, the authority that waived the requirements may, if it considers that it is just and reasonable to do so, make a determination that the company is not entitled to any deduction in respect of that acquisition beginning with a specified year of assessment. Where such determination is made \u2014\n(a) any deduction already made for the specified or a subsequent year of assessment is treated as having been wrongly allowed, and the\nComptroller may make an assessment on the company to make good any tax shortfall; and\n(b) no further deduction may be allowed to the company for the qualifying acquisition.\nClause 29 amends section 39 (Relief and deduction for resident individual) to allow a woman resident in Singapore to claim deduction for the year of assessment 2020 and any subsequent year of assessment, in respect of the woman's handicapped and unmarried child who was looked after by the child's grandparent or great-grandparent in the preceding year, regardless of the child's\nage. No deduction may be claimed under this subsection in any year of assessment if the child becomes married in that year of assessment. Clause 29 also amends subsection (2)(e) to reflect the policy intent.\nClause 30 amends section 43 (Rate of tax upon companies and others) \u2014\n(a) to extend till 31 December 2025 the date distributions from certain income by an approved REIT exchange-traded fund are to be received from a REIT, to enjoy tax transparency;\n(b) to extend till 31 December 2025 the date distributions from certain income are to be made by the trustee of a REIT or REIT exchange-traded fund, for the distributions to enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 10%; and\n(c) to insert new subsections (3D), (3E) and (3F) which apply the concessionary tax rate of 10% to a distribution made out of certain incomes during the period from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2025 by a trustee of a REIT, or a trustee of an approved REIT exchange-traded fund, to certain persons or entities that are eligible for tax exemptions for their income under sections 13CA, 13X and 13Y.\nClause 31 amends subsection (2) of section 43A (Concessionary rate of tax for\nAsian Currency Unit, Fund Manager and securities company), which (among other matters) enables regulations to be made to exempt from tax income of an approved bank, a merchant bank, or a holder of a capital markets services licence to deal in securities, from certain syndicated facilities. Regulations may further be made to treat an expected credit loss recognised under the financial reporting standard known as FRS 109, as chargeable income. The amendment adds a reference in the latter to the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 9.\nClause 32 amends section 43C (Exemption and concessionary rate of tax for insurance and reinsurance business) \u2014\n(a) to limit subsection (1)(a) (which enables regulations to be made applying a concessionary tax rate of 10% to income from certain offshore businesses of an approved insurer whose approval is granted before 1 June 2017) to income derived before 1 July 2021; and\n(b) to insert a new paragraph (ab) in subsection (1) to enable regulations to be made applying a concessionary tax rate of 10% to income derived on or after 1 July 2021 from certain general businesses and life reinsurance businesses, by an approved insurer whose approval is granted before 1 June 2017.\nClause 33 amends section 43N (Concessionary rate of tax for income derived from debt securities) to update the definition of \"primary dealer\", which is now set out in the Government Securities Act (Cap. 121A) rather than in regulations made under it.\nClause 34 amends section 43ZA (Concessionary rate of tax for container investment enterprise) which provides for a concessionary rate of tax to be levied and paid on the income of an approved container investment enterprise accruing in or derived from Singapore from the leasing of any container or intermodal equipment that is acquired by the enterprise before or during the period of its approval, and income derived from foreign exchange and risk management activities in connection with and incidental to the leasing.\nThe amendment extends the section by applying the concessionary rate of tax to income derived on or after 12 December 2018 by an approved container investment enterprise from the leasing of a container or intermodal equipment, that the enterprise had leased from an approved related party. This applies only if the container or intermodal equipment was acquired by the related party before or during the period of the approval of the related party. The concessionary tax rate also applies to foreign exchange and risk management activities connected with or incidental to such leasing.\nClause 34 further amends section 43ZA to disapply the concessionary tax rate under that section to income derived by an approved container investment enterprise on or after 12 December 2018 in relation to a container or intermodal\nequipment acquired by way of a finance lease entered into with an entity that is not an approved related party.\nClause 35 amends section 45AA (Tax deemed withheld and recoverable from person in breach of condition imposed under section 13(4)) which provides that where the payer of a payment to a non-resident person under section 45 or 45A contravenes any condition imposed under a notification made under section 13(4), the amount of tax which would have been deductible by the payer from that payment under that section is deemed to have been deducted from the payment and recoverable from the payer by the Comptroller.\nSection 45AA is amended to apply also to a case where the payer, or a particular matter, is approved under a provision of the Act set out in the new Fourth\nSchedule, and the payment is exempt from tax under a section 13(4) notification on that basis. If the approval is then revoked under the new section 105R after any such payment is made, the amount of tax which would have been deductible by the payer from that payment under section 45 or 45A is deemed to have been so deducted and recoverable from the payer by the Comptroller.\nClause 36 amends section 45G (Application of section 45 to distribution from any real estate investment trust) \u2014\n(a) to apply the reduced withholding tax rate in subsection (2) on distributions by a trustee of a REIT or an approved REIT exchange-traded fund, to persons to whom the concessionary tax rate under subsection (3C) or the new subsection (3D) or (3E) of section 43 applies; and\n(b) to extend the date by which a distribution is to be made to enjoy a withholding tax rate of 10%, to 31 December 2025.\nClause 37 inserts a new section 45J to reflect that certain withholding tax obligations under Part XII are applicable to the Government. However, no civil or criminal action may be taken against the Government to enforce such obligations.\nClause 38 amends section 83 (Proceedings before Board and High Court) to remove the requirement for hearings before the High Court and the Court of\nAppeal to be in camera.\nClause 39 amends subsection (2) of section 101 (Consent for prosecution) to enable the Comptroller to authorise an officer to compound an offence under section 34F(8). Section 34F(8) criminalises the failure to prepare transfer pricing documentation, the failure to retain in safe custody such documentation for a specified period, and the failure to comply with a notice from the Comptroller to provide a copy of such documentation.\nClause 40 inserts a new section 105R to enable the approval of a taxpayer or a matter for a tax incentive under a section of the Act prescribed in the Fourth\nSchedule to be revoked for a breach of a condition of approval. The consequence\nof a breach of a condition of approval is set out in the new section 105R, and replaces any representation as to the consequences of such breach set out in a letter of approval given to the taxpayer concerned.\nClause 40 also inserts a new section 105S to treat, for the purposes of section 105R, every condition imposed or specified by the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint before the commencement date of section 105S under section 43G(2), 43P(2), 43Q(2), 43R(2), 43W(3), 43Y(2), 43Z(3), 43ZB(3), 43ZC(3) or 43ZD(3) as a condition imposed on the approval in relation to a\nFinance and Treasury Centre or person (as the case may be) under section 43G, 43P, 43Q, 43R, 43W, 43Y, 43Z, 43ZB, 43ZC or 43ZD.\nClause 41 amends section 106 (Powers to amend Schedules) to enable the\nFourth Schedule (inserted by the Bill) to be amended by the Minister by an order.\nClause 42 inserts a new Fourth Schedule for the purposes of the new section 105R.\nClause 43 makes miscellaneous amendments to sections 43G, 43N, 43P, 43Q, 43R, 43W, 43Y, 43Z, 43ZB, 43ZC and 43ZD that are related to the new sections 105R and 105S. From the date of commencement of sections 105R and 105S, the Minister or such person as the Minister may appoint may impose conditions of approval for any tax incentive given under section 43G, 43P, 43Q, 43R, 43W, 43Y, 43Z, 43ZB, 43ZC or 43ZD. Any such approval is liable to be revoked under the new section 105R.\nClause 44 repeals provisions of the Act that are obsolete.\nClause 45 makes an amendment to subsection (18A) of section 15A (Relief from ad valorem stamp duty for acquisition of shares of companies) of the Stamp\nDuties Act that is related to the amendment made to section 37L of the Income Tax\nAct. Subsection (18A) empowers the Minister to make rules subjecting the right to relief for certain share acquisitions to conditions designed to ensure that the acquiring company or acquiring subsidiary is not merely a passive investor, including a condition that the acquiring company or acquiring subsidiary must exert \"significant influence\" (within the meaning of certain financial reporting standards) over the target company. The amendment adds a reference in the latter to the financial reporting standard known as SFRS(I) 1-28.\nClause 46 provides for a remission of the tax payable by a resident individual for the year of assessment 2019. The amount of remission is 50% of the tax payable or $200, whichever is lower.\nClause 47 enables the Minister, for a period of 2 years from the commencement of the clause, to make saving and transitional provisions by regulations for the purposes of the Bill.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

These new modes are service by short message service (also known as SMS), email and an electronic service platform.\nIn tandem with the introduction of the new modes of service, section 30(3) is amended to set out the conditions which must be met before a person served via one of the new modes of service may be presumed or deemed to have received and read or heard the order or notice.\nClause 10 inserts a new section 30A to provide for the proper authority's electronic service platform for the service of orders or notices issued or made under the Enlistment Act 1970.\nClause 11 removes references to registration from section 32(1). A person subject to the Enlistment Act 1970 (as defined in section 2) and a relevant child (as defined in section 32(5)) are prohibited from leaving or remaining outside\nSingapore without an exit permit, unless an exemption is provided for in the regulations.\nClause 12 amends section 37 to clarify the scope of the Minister's regulation\u2010making powers.\nClause 13 makes certain miscellaneous amendments. First, the clause amends section 7 to include express references to the SPF and the SCDF. Second, the clause replaces the references to the People's Defence Force of the SAF and the\nSpecial Constabulary under the Police Force Act 2004 in relation to voluntary service in sections 22(1)(c), 23(1)(c) and 24(1)(c) and (6)(b) of the Enlistment\nAct 1970 with references to only voluntary service in the SAF. The references to\nSAF volunteers in the People's Defence Force are obsolete. The effect of the amendments is that all SAF volunteers (including volunteer ex\u2010NSmen) will be protected under sections 23 and 24. All SAF volunteers subject to the Enlistment\nAct 1970 will also be protected under section 22.\nAlthough the references to voluntary service in the Special Constabulary are removed, volunteer ex\u2010NSmen in the SPF continue to be afforded the protection under Part 6 of the Enlistment Act 1970 by virtue of the incorporation of these provisions via section 68A of the Police Force Act 2004. For completeness, a consequential amendment will be made to the Police Force Act 2004 by clause 17.\nVolunteer ex\u2010NSmen in the SCDF are similarly afforded protection via section 9A of the Civil Defence Act 1986. It is therefore not necessary to expressly mention volunteer ex\u2010NSmen in the SPF and SCDF in the Enlistment Act 1970.\nPART 2\nAMENDMENT OF REQUISITION OF RESOURCES ACT 1985\nClauses 14 and 15 amend the Requisition of Resources Act 1985.\nClause 14 amends section 41 (on orders, notices and requisitions) to align the provisions on service of orders, notices, directions or requisitions with the amendments to be made by clause 9 to similar provisions in section 30 of the\nEnlistment Act 1970. Section 41 is also updated to clarify how they apply to partnerships, bodies corporate (including limited liability partnerships) and unincorporated associations and the officers of these entities.\nClause 15 replaces section 46 with an updated standard provision on proving the state of mind of a body corporate and the liability of officers of the body corporate for offences committed by the body corporate. The clause also inserts a new section 46A which is a standard provision similar to the new section 46, but which applies to officers of offenders that are unincorporated associations or partnerships.\nPART 3\nClause 16 makes an amendment to section 52(1) of the Immigration Act 1959 which is consequential to the amendment in clause 11 relating to exit permit requirements.\nClause 17 makes an amendment to section 68A(1) of the Police Force Act 2004 which is consequential to the amendment in clause 13, which removes the references to voluntary service in the Special Constabulary under the Police Force\nAct 2004 in sections 22(1)(c), 23(1)(c) and 24(1)(c) and (6)(b) of the Enlistment\nAct 1970. As a result, sections 23, 24 and 25 (as well as sections 21 and 22) of the\nEnlistment Act 1970 will continue to apply to every police officer in the Special\nConstabulary who is a volunteer ex\u2010NSman. These sections will however not apply to a volunteer in the Special Constabulary who is not a volunteer ex\u2010NSman, except when such a volunteer is mobilised under section 73 of the Police Force\nAct 2004.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.\n31",

or\n(b) the value of any part of such supply of water, payment for which has been waived by the Public Utilities Board.\nSaving and transitional provisions 22.\u2014(1) Section 68B of the principal Act (as inserted by section 15) does not apply in relation to an overpayment, erroneous payment or erroneous collection of any money, made before the date\nof commencement of section 15, if the claim for a refund or return of any money so overpaid, erroneously paid or erroneously collected is made to the Public Utilities Board before that date.\n(2) For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any provision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such\nadditional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that provision as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Public Utilities Act 2001 (the Act) for the following purposes:\n(a) to provide for new facilities in prescribed industries to include water efficiency measures, including the recycling of used water;\n(b) to require persons other than the Public Utilities Board (the Board) to seek the Board's approval before relocating or altering water installations belonging to or under the management or control of the\nBoard;\n(c) to provide for the charging of the waterborne tax (WBT) and the water conservation tax (WCT) on private water suppliers (PWSes);\n(d) to clarify various provisions in the Act, and to enhance the administration and enforcement of the Act by the Board.\nThe Bill also makes related amendments to the Sewerage and Drainage\nAct 1999.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 to insert 2 new definitions for \"extract\" and \"extracted water\".\nClause 3 inserts a new section 7A to enable the Board, when administering or enforcing the Act (which deals with, among other things, water installations and the supply of water), to take into consideration matters under the Sewerage and\nDrainage Act 1999 (which deals with, among other things, sewerage and drainage systems, and the discharge of sewage and trade effluent), and vice versa. The\nBoard manages the entire water loop, including maintaining water catchment areas, treating and supplying water, and collecting and treating used water.\nSingapore's water installations, and sewerage and drainage systems, are closely related and matters done to one system could easily affect the other. The new section 7A enables the Board to adopt a holistic approach when dealing with matters concerning any of the systems.\nClause 4 amends section 20 (Tariffs for supply of water and apparatus, etc., payable to Board) to enable WBT to be charged in relation to water supplied by persons other than the Board, in particular, PWSes. PWSes are persons who have obtained approval from the Board under section 31 of the Sewerage and Drainage\nAct 1999 to construct works for the purpose of taking or intercepting water, viz., seawater and rainwater. PWSes may use the extracted water themselves or supply the extracted water to their customers (or both), whether as is or after the extracted water has been subject to some treatment (water derived from extracted water).\nThe amendments to section 20 will enable the imposition of WBT in relation to such water, and further enable the circumstances in which WBT is imposed and the amount of WBT in these circumstances to be more finely calibrated.\nClause 4(h) replaces section 20(13) to enable the Board (with the approval of the Minister charged with the responsibility for sustainability and the environment (the Minister)), in addition to rebates on the WBT, to administratively grant waivers of WBT and rebates on or waivers of the price for the supply of water by the Board.\nClause 5 inserts a new section 20A to enable the WCT, currently imposed under the Statutory Boards (Taxable Services) Act 1968, to be imposed under the Act instead. In addition, the new section 20A enables the scope of the WCT to be expanded to cover water supplied by PWSes.\nClause 6 amends section 24A (Power to enter premises for installation of pipes, water installations, etc.) to regularise the Board's current practice of entering any premises (with notice given to the owner or occupier) to maintain and repair water installations that are acquired by the Board but not leased to another entity.\nSection 24A is also amended to expand the power of the Board in installing meters at PWSes' premises. With the expanded scope of the WBT and WCT to cover extracted water and water derived from extracted water, meters will now have to be installed at PWSes' premises, so that the amount of such water used by PWSes, as well as the amount of such water supplied by PWSes, can be metered.\nClause 7 amends section 24B (Board may act in cases of emergency) to enable the Board to recover its cost or expense in carrying out any work or doing any act that the Board is authorised to do under section 33, from the person who caused any hindrance or obstruction or likely hindrance or obstruction mentioned in section 33, which necessitates the work or act on the part of the Board.\nSection 24B relates to situations of emergency, where it would not be appropriate for the Board to invoke its power under section 33 by written notice to direct the person to remove the structure, object or accumulation of substance causing or likely to cause the hindrance or obstruction within a time specified in the notice.\nClause 8 replaces section 26 (Relocation of water installation). Under the existing section 26, the Board may relocate any water installation at any premises, at the request of the owner or occupier of the premises. The new section 26 prohibits a person other than the Board from relocating or altering any water installation belonging to or under the management or control of the Board, without the Board's approval. The Board may impose conditions on its approval, including for ownership in any new, replacement or altered water installation to be transferred to the Board, and for warranties against defects in the new, replacement or altered water installation to be provided to the Board. Under the new section 26(5), any person carrying out, or causing to be carried out, any works for the relocation or alteration of the water installation must pay certain costs and expenses of the\nBoard, for the\nBoard's involvement in inspecting, decommissioning and commissioning the water installation. Among other things, the new section 26(12) retains the current power of the Board to carry out the relocation (or alteration) on request as a residual power.\nClause 9 amends section 31 (Power to enter premises to examine pipes, etc.) to expand the powers of the Board under the section to deal with situations involving extracted water and water derived from extracted water, whether used by PWSes themselves or supplied by PWSes to their customers.\nClause 10(a) and (b) amends the section heading of section 33 (Removal of obstruction over existing water main, connecting pipe or meter) and section 33(1) and (2) to make reference to \"water installation\" in place of \"water main, connecting pipe or meter\". This expands the ambit of section 33 to cover all aspects of a water installation (which includes components such as water valve chambers and hydrants, and thus goes beyond water mains, connecting pipes and meters).\nClause 10(c) inserts a new subsection (3) in section 33 to clarify that powers of the Board under section 33(2)(b) are independent of and not contingent on any prosecution and conviction pursuant to section 33(2)(a).\nClause 11 amends section 35 (Penalty or late payment charge) to make clear that it applies to the price for the supply of water by the Board, and to enable the\nBoard (with the Minister's approval) to administratively waive the payment of any late payment charges imposed under the section.\nClause 12 inserts a new section 40 to impose water efficiency requirements on a new facility built for any purpose that would require the use of water, where the business activity for which the new facility is built falls under a prescribed industry and the annual water use exceeds a prescribed threshold. Before any\n31\nbuilding works for a new facility can begin, the Board's approval for a projected water balance chart must be obtained. Once operations at the new facility begin, the occupier of the new facility must ensure compliance with prescribed water efficiency requirements. Water efficiency requirements include the recycling of used water.\nClauses 13 and 14 amend sections 47 (Damage to property of Board) and 47A (Damage to water mains and installations, etc.), respectively, to align these with some of the new provisions introduced in the new section 26 (inserted by clause 8).\nClause 15 inserts a new section 68B to provide for a time-bar of 5 years for claims against the Board for the refund or return of any money overpaid or erroneously paid by a person to the Board, or erroneously collected from the person.\nClause 16 replaces section 70 (Service of documents). The new section 70 updates the various means by which service of documents may be effected for the purposes of the Act.\nClause 17 inserts a new section 70A to enable the Board and persons making applications to the Board to use the electronic system established under the\nBuilding Control Act 1989 for the service of documents.\nClause 18 amends section 72 (Regulations) to expand on and clarify the matters for which regulations may be made under the Act. In particular, section 72(2)(ia) is amended to expressly enable the Board to make regulations related to the supply and use of water equipment. Separately, the new section 72(2)(la) enables regulations to be made to require PWSes to make it clear in their billings to customers to whom they supply extracted water or water derived from extracted water, that the amount the PWS is charging for such water includes WBT or WCT payable by the PWS in respect of such water, which the PWS is passing on to the customer.\nClause 19 makes editorial amendments to various provisions in the Act to standardise the phrasing of terms throughout the Act, and remove unnecessary words.\nClause 20 makes a clarificatory amendment to section 41 of the Sewerage and\nDrainage Act 1999, similar to the amendment in clause 10(c). The clause also replaces section 62 of the Sewerage and Drainage Act 1999 (Service of notices, etc.) and inserts a new section 62A. The new sections 62 and 62A mirror the new sections 70 and 70A being inserted in the Act by clauses 16 and 17.\nClause 21 provides for a validation of amounts paid as goods and services tax to the Board before 1 September 2022, in connection with the supply of water by the\nBoard, except in certain instances.\nClause 22 provides for saving and transitional matters.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The new section 34(1)(a) provides that no appeal is to be brought to the Court of Appeal in any case where a Judge makes an order specified in the new Fourth Schedule (to be inserted by clause 14), except in such circumstances as may be specified in that Schedule. The existing paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 34(1) are no longer required, as the matters referred to in those paragraphs will now be referred to in the new Fourth Schedule.\nClause 9(a) also deletes paragraph (c) of section 34(1), so that it is no longer a requirement for a party to apply for further argument in court before he can bring an appeal to the Court of Appeal against an interlocutory order made by a Judge in chambers.\nClause 9(b) amends section 34(2) to provide that where a matter is appealable to the\nCourt of Appeal only with leave, that leave must be obtained from a Judge and not the\nCourt of Appeal.\nClause 9(c) deletes and substitutes paragraph (a) of section 34(2) to restate the matters referred to in that paragraph.

To avoid doubt, an electronic transferable record is not to\nbe denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record.\nRequirement for writing\n16F. Section 7 applies to an electronic transferable record as it applies to an electronic record within the meaning of section 2(1).\nRequirement for signature\n16G.

Where a rule of law requires the indication of time or place with respect to a transferable document or instrument, or provides for certain consequences if time or place is not indicated with respect to a transferable document or instrument, that requirement is met if a reliable method is used to indicate\nthat time or place with respect to an electronic transferable record.\nIndorsement\n16K. Where a rule of law requires the indorsement in any form of a transferable document or instrument, or provides for certain\nconsequences if a transferable document or instrument is not indorsed, that requirement is met with respect to an electronic transferable record if the information required for the indorsement is included in the electronic transferable record in\ncompliance with the requirements for writing and signature in sections 16F and 16G respectively.\nAmendment\n16L. Where a rule of law requires the amendment of a\ntransferable document or instrument, or provides for certain consequences if a transferable document or instrument is not amended, that requirement is met with respect to an electronic transferable record if a reliable method is used for the amendment of any information in the electronic transferable\nrecord so that the amended information is identified as such.\nChange of medium from transferable document or instrument to electronic transferable record 16M.\u2014(1) An electronic transferable record may replace a transferable document or instrument if a reliable method for the\nchange of medium in accordance with this section is used.\n(2) For the change of medium mentioned in subsection (1) to take effect, the following requirements must be satisfied:\n(a) all the information contained in the transferable document or instrument must be accurately\nreproduced in the electronic transferable record that replaces the transferable document or instrument;\n(b) a statement indicating a change of medium must be inserted in the electronic transferable record that replaces the transferable document or instrument.\n(3) Upon the issuance of the electronic transferable record in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), the transferable document or instrument \u2014\n(a) ceases to have any effect or validity; and\n(b) must be made inoperative.\n(4) A change of medium in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) does not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.\nChange of medium from electronic transferable record to transferable document or instrument 16N.\u2014(1) A transferable document or instrument may replace an electronic transferable record if a reliable method for the\nchange of medium in accordance with this section is used.\n(2) For the change of medium mentioned in subsection (1) to take effect, the following requirements must be satisfied:\n(a) all the information contained in the electronic transferable record must be accurately reproduced\nin the transferable document or instrument that replaces the electronic transferable record;\n(b) a statement indicating a change of medium must be inserted in the transferable document or instrument that replaces the electronic transferable record.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), the information in the electronic transferable record that must be accurately reproduced in the transferable document or instrument that replaces the electronic transferable record does not include any additional information that may be contained in an electronic\ntransferable record mentioned in section 16C.\n(4) Upon the issuance of the transferable document or instrument in accordance with subsections (1) and (2), the electronic transferable record \u2014\n(a) ceases to have any effect or validity; and\n(b) must be made inoperative.\n(5) A change of medium in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) does not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.\nDivision 4 \u2014 General reliability standard\nGeneral reliability standard\n16O.\u2014(1) For the purposes of sections 16G, 16H, 16I, 16J, 16L, 16M and 16N, the reliable method mentioned in each of these provisions must be \u2014\n(a) as reliable as appropriate for the fulfilment of the function for which the method is being used, in the light of all the relevant circumstances, which may include \u2014\n(i) any operational rules that are relevant to the assessment of reliability;\n(ii) the assurance of data integrity;\n(iii) the ability to prevent unauthorised access to and use of the system;\n(iv) the security of hardware and software;\n(v) the regularity and extent of audit by an independent body;\n(vi) the existence of a declaration by a supervisory body, an accreditation body or a voluntary\nscheme, regarding the reliability of the method; or\n(vii) any applicable industry standard; or\n(b) proven in fact to have fulfilled the function by itself or together with any further evidence.\n(2) In any proceedings involving an electronic transferable record that is issued, transferred, controlled, presented and stored by means of an accredited electronic transferable records management system provided by a provider that is registered, licensed, accredited or recognised in accordance with\nregulations made under section 16Q, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is adduced, that the methods used by the electronic transferable records management system to fulfil the requirements under this Part in relation to the electronic transferable record are as reliable as appropriate.\n(3) The presumption in subsection (2) applies only if the electronic transferable record is issued, transferred, controlled, presented and stored by means of the accredited electronic transferable records management system provided by the\nprovider during the period in which the provider is registered, licensed, accredited or recognised under this Part.\nDivision 5 \u2014 Cross-border recognition of electronic transferable record\nNon-discrimination of foreign electronic transferable\nrecords 16P.\u2014(1) An electronic transferable record is not to be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on the ground that it was issued or used outside Singapore.\n(2) Nothing in this Part affects the application to an electronic\ntransferable record of any rule of private international law governing a transferable document or instrument.\nDivision 6 \u2014 Accreditation, etc., of provider of electronic transferable records management system\nRegulations\n16Q.\u2014(1) The Minister may make regulations for the carrying out of this Part and, without limiting such general power, may make regulations for the following purposes:\n(a) the registration, licensing or accreditation of providers of an electronic transferable records\nmanagement system;\n(b) the accreditation of electronic transferable records management systems that satisfy the requirements of providing a reliable method under section 16O for the fulfilment of the requirements in relation to an\nelectronic transferable record under this Part;\n(c) to prescribe the accounts to be kept by a provider of an electronic transferable records management system\nthat is registered, licensed or accredited under this\nPart;\n(d) to provide for the appointment and remuneration of an auditor for the audit of a provider of an electronic\ntransferable records management system that is registered, licensed or accredited under this Part, and for the costs of an audit carried out under the regulations;\n(e) to provide for the use of any accreditation mark in\nrelation to the activities of a provider of an electronic transferable records management system in relation to such system, and for controls over the use of such accreditation mark;\n(f) to prescribe the duties and liabilities of a provider of\nan electronic transferable records management system that is registered, licensed or accredited under this Part in respect of its customers;\n(g) to provide for the conduct of any inquiry into the conduct of any provider of an electronic transferable\nrecords management system and its authorised representatives and the recovery of the costs and expenses involved in such an inquiry;\n(h) to prescribe the forms and fees applicable for the purposes of this Part.\n(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may make regulations to provide for the cross-border recognition of a provider of an electronic transferable records management system that is incorporated, formed or established in a country or territory outside Singapore (called in this section a foreign\nprovider) where the foreign provider \u2014\n(a) is registered, licensed or accredited under a particular registration, licensing or accreditation scheme (as the case may be) established outside Singapore;

Section 38 of the principal Act is amended by deleting the words \"section 22\" wherever they appear and substituting in each case the words \"sections 16Q and 22\".\nAmendment of First Schedule\n8. Item 2 of the First Schedule to the principal Act is deleted.\nRelated amendments to Bills of Lading Act\n9. The Bills of Lading Act (Cap. 384) is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting subsections (5) and (6) of section 1;\n(b) by deleting the semi-colon at the end of the definition of \"holder\" in section 5(1) and substituting a full-stop; and\n(c) by deleting the definitions of \"information technology\" and \"telecommunication system\" in section 5(1).\nConsequential and related amendments to Contracts (Rights of\nThird Parties) Act\n10. Section 7 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act\n(Cap. 53B) is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \", sea waybill or a corresponding electronic transaction\" in paragraph (a) of the definition of \"contract for the carriage of goods by sea\" in subsection (5) and substituting the words \"or sea waybill\";\n(b) by deleting the words \"or a corresponding electronic transaction\" in paragraph (b) of the definition of \"contract for the carriage of goods by sea\" in subsection (5); and\n(c) by deleting subsection (6) and substituting the following subsection:\n\"(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), \"bill of lading\", \"sea waybill\" and \"ship's delivery order\" have the meanings given by the Bills of Lading Act.\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88) for the following purposes:\n(a) to adopt with modifications the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic\nTransferable Records adopted by the United Nations Commission on\nInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on 13 July 2017 (called the\nModel Law);\n(b) to amend section 13 to achieve consistency with Article 10 of the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (called the ECC);\n(c) to delete item 2 of the First Schedule, in conjunction with the adoption of the Model Law.\nThe Bill also makes consequential and related amendments to the Bills of\nLading Act (Cap. 384) and the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap. 53B).\nThe adoption of the Model Law, together with the deletion of item 2 of the First\nSchedule, is part of a wider and ongoing initiative by the Government to review and support the electronisation of various types of instruments or transactions, including the other matters specified in the First Schedule. These other matters will be deleted when the legislative and administrative frameworks supporting the electronisation of these other items are ready to be enacted or implemented.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends the long title to add a reference to the adoption of the Model\nLaw.\nClause 3 amends subsections (1) and (3)(c) and (d) of section 2 (Interpretation) to insert a new definition of \"electronic transferable record\" and to give effect to\nArticle 14 of the Model Law.\nClause 4 amends section 3 (Purposes and construction) which sets out the purposes of the Act. The clause inserts a new paragraph (h) to provide that it is a purpose of the Act to adopt the Model Law in its application to an electronic transferable record, whether the electronic transferable record is issued or used in\nSingapore or outside Singapore.\nClause 5 amends section 13 (Time and place of despatch and receipt) which implements Article 10 of the ECC. The existing subsection (4) provides that an electronic communication is presumed to be capable of being retrieved by the addressee when it reaches the electronic address of the addressee for the purposes of subsection (3). Subsection (3) provides the rule for determining the time of receipt of an electronic communication at an electronic address in a case where the electronic address has not been designated by the addressee.\nHowever, in accordance with Article 10 of the ECC, the presumption should also apply in determining the time of receipt of an electronic communication at an electronic address in a case where the electronic address has been designated by the addressee, which is the subject of subsection (2). The clause therefore seeks to make section 13(4) consistent with Article 10 of the ECC.\nClause 6 inserts a new Part IIA, comprising new sections 16A to 16S.\nThe new section 16A adopts Article 2 of the Model Law and provides the definitions for \"electronic record\", \"electronic transferable record\" and \"transferable document or instrument\". It also provides the definitions for \"bill of exchange\", \"bill of lading\", \"Model Law\", \"promissory note\", \"electronic transferable records management system\" and the \"provider\" of such a system for the purposes of the new Part IIA.\nThe definition of \"electronic record\" in the new section 16A(1) is different from the definition of \"electronic record\" in section 2(1) in 2 aspects:\n(a) the words \"in an information system or for transmission from one information system to another\" in the definition of \"electronic record\" in section 2(1) are omitted from the definition of \"electronic record\" in the new section 16A(1). This is due to the possibility that an electronic record that constitutes an electronic transferable record may not be transmitted from one information system to another;\n(b) the definition of \"electronic record\" in the new section 16A(1) includes the words \"including (where appropriate) all information logically associated with or otherwise linked together so as to become part of the record, whether generated contemporaneously or not\", which do not appear in the definition of \"electronic record\" in section 2(1). These words refer to the possibility that an electronic record that constitutes an electronic transferable record may include a set of composite information, for example, the electronic record may include information effecting indorsements or amendments. A piece of information is \"logically associated\" with another piece of information if they are electronically connected with each other by means of computer software.\nThe term \"transferable document or instrument\" is defined as a document or an instrument that is issued on paper, and that entitles the holder \u2014\n(a) to claim the performance of the obligation that is indicated in the document or instrument; and\n(b) to transfer the right to performance of the obligation that is indicated in the document or instrument through the transfer of that document or instrument.\nThe definition of \"transferable document or instrument\" is a descriptive definition. Substantive law determines which documents or instruments fall within the definition, as well as the rights of the person in possession of the transferable document or instrument.\nThe definition also contains a non-exhaustive list of 3 examples of transferable documents or instruments, namely, a bill of exchange, a promissory note and a bill of lading. Any other document or instrument that is (or may in the future acquire the status of) a transferable document or instrument (e.g. a document of title through proof of mercantile custom to that effect), would also fall within the definition.\nThe definitions of \"bill of exchange\" and \"promissory note\" (which terms are used in the definition of \"transferable document or instrument\") provide respectively that a \"bill of exchange\" and \"promissory note\" include a bill of exchange and promissory note within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act, or under any other rule of law, or under the law of a country or territory outside\nSingapore.\nThe definition of \"bill of lading\" (which term is used in the definition of \"transferable document or instrument\") provides that a \"bill of lading\" includes a bill of lading within the meaning of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the Bills of\nLading Act or under any other rule of law (e.g. the Factors Act), or under the law of a country or territory outside Singapore.\nThe term \"electronic transferable record\" is defined as an electronic record that complies with the requirements of the new section 16H, which provides the functional equivalence rule for the electronic functional equivalent of a transferable document or instrument.\nThe term \"provider\", in relation to an electronic transferable records management system, is defined as a person (i.e. a system provider or service provider) that provides, to another person (i.e. an end-user), the use of an electronic transferable records management system.\nThe new section 16A(2)(a) adopts Article 3(1) of the Model Law by providing that in interpreting the provisions of the new Part IIA, regard is to be had to the international origin of the Model Law and to the need to promote uniformity in its application. The new section 16A(2)(c) adopts Article 3(2) of the Model Law by providing that any question concerning matters which are not expressly settled in the new Part IIA are to be settled in conformity with the general principles on which the Model Law is based. In addition, the new section 16A(2)(b) provides that any document relating to the Model Law issued by, or that is part of the record\non the preparation of the Model Law maintained by, the UNCITRAL and its working group that prepared the Model Law, as well as the Explanatory Note to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records, are relevant documents for the purposes of section 9A(3)(f) of the Interpretation Act for the purposes of interpreting any provision of the new Part IIA.\nThe new section 16B provides that the new Part IIA adopts the Model Law in its application to an electronic transferable record in accordance with the provisions of that Part. It also states that unless otherwise provided, the new Part IIA does not affect any application of any rule of law governing a transferable document or instrument.\nThe new section 16C adopts with modification Article 6 of the Model Law by providing that the new Part IIA does not preclude the inclusion of any information in an electronic transferable record that is in addition to any information contained in a transferable document or instrument. The information contained in a transferable document or instrument includes information that is required by substantive law to be contained in a transferable document or instrument for its issuance and use, as well as information that is permitted (but not required) to be included in a transferable document or instrument. The additional information mentioned in the new section 16C refers to additional information that may be contained in an electronic transferable record due to its electronic nature.\nExamples of such additional information that may be contained in an electronic transferable record due to its electronic nature include metadata, a unique identifier or information that may change periodically or continuously based on an external source (i.e. dynamic information, such as the geographical location of the shipped cargo mentioned in an electronic bill of lading). A paper bill of lading may contain static information which is a reference to external dynamic information, such as a reference to a URL for an Internet website containing dynamic information. Such a static reference (i.e. URL) would fall within the phrase \"information contained in a transferable document or instrument\" in the new section 16C. When included in an electronic bill of lading, such a static reference is not additional information that may be contained in an electronic transferable record due to its electronic nature, and will therefore need to be accurately reproduced in a change of medium under the new section 16N.\nThe new section 16D(1) and (2) adopts Article 7(2) and (3) of the Model Law by providing that the new Part IIA does not require a person to use an electronic transferable record without the person's consent. For this purpose, the consent of a person to use an electronic transferable record does not need to be expressly indicated or given in any particular form, and may be inferred from the person's conduct. The new section 16D(3) also provides that parties who do not consent to the use of an electronic transferable record may derogate from all the provisions of the new Part IIA. However, parties are not permitted to derogate from only some (but not all) of those provisions, which is consistent with the fact that the\nsubstantive law relating to transferable documents or instruments is of mandatory application and cannot be derogated from or varied by the parties.\nThe new section 16E adopts Article 7(1) of the Model Law. It provides that an electronic transferable record is not to be denied legal effect solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record.\nThe new section 16F adopts Article 8 of the Model Law. It provides that section 7, which is consistent with Article 8 of the Model Law, applies to an electronic transferable record.\nThe new section 16G adopts Article 9 of the Model Law by providing a functional equivalence rule for a signature. An electronic signature used in relation to an electronic transferable record satisfies any rule of law that requires a signature of a person or provides for certain consequences if a transferable document or instrument is not signed, if the electronic signature is a reliable method that identifies the person and indicates the person's intention in respect of the information contained in the electronic transferable record. The functional equivalence rule for a signature in the new section 16G is different from the analogous rule in section 8 in that the new section 16O (which applies to the new section 16G) differs from section 8(b).\nThe new section 16H adopts with modification Article 10 of the Model Law by providing a functional equivalence rule for a transferable document or instrument.\nAn electronic record satisfies the requirements of a transferable document or instrument if \u2014\n(a) the electronic record contains the information that would be required to be contained in the transferable document or instrument; and\n(b) a reliable method is used \u2014\n(i) to identify that electronic record as the authoritative electronic record constituting the electronic transferable record;\n(ii) to render that electronic record capable of being subject to control from the time of its creation to the time it ceases to have any effect or validity; and\n(iii) to retain the integrity of that electronic record.\nThe criterion for assessing the integrity of an electronic record is whether information contained in it, including any authorised change that arises from the time of its creation to the time it ceases to have any effect or validity, has remained complete and unaltered. A change to information contained in an electronic transferable record is an \"authorised change\" if the change is as agreed upon by the parties to contractual obligations related to the electronic transferable record (such a change may be made at any time throughout the life cycle of the electronic transferable record), and permitted by the electronic transferable records\nmanagement system. Any change that arises in the normal course of communication, storage or display does not affect the integrity of the electronic transferable record.\nThe new section 16I(1) adopts Article 11 of the Model Law by providing a functional equivalence rule for the possession of a transferable document or instrument. An electronic transferable record satisfies any rule of law that requires the possession of a transferable document or instrument or provides for certain consequences if a transferable document or instrument is not possessed, if a reliable method is used to establish exclusive control of the electronic transferable record by a person and to identify the person in control. The person in control of an electronic transferable record is in the same legal position as the person in possession of an equivalent transferable document or instrument. The new section 16I(2) provides that the transfer of control over an electronic transferable record is the functional equivalent of the transfer of possession of a transferable document or instrument. The type of control that is to be transferred to another person pursuant to the new section 16I(2) is control that fulfils all the requirements of the new section 16I(1).\nThe new section 16J adopts Article 13 of the Model Law by providing that any rule of law that requires the indication of time or place with respect to a transferable document or instrument or provides for certain consequences if time or place is not indicated with respect to a transferable document or instrument is satisfied if a reliable method is used to indicate the time or place with respect to an electronic transferable record.\nThe new section 16K adopts Article 15 of the Model Law by providing a functional equivalence rule for the indorsement in any form of a transferable document or instrument. A rule of law that requires the indorsement in any form (e.g. indorsement on the back of a transferable document or instrument or by affixing an allonge) of a transferable document or instrument or provides for certain consequences if a transferable document or instrument is not indorsed, is satisfied with respect to an electronic transferable record if the information required for the indorsement is included in the electronic transferable record in compliance with the requirements for writing and signature in the new sections 16F and 16G respectively.\nThe new section 16L adopts Article 16 of the Model Law by providing a functional equivalence rule for the amendment of a transferable document or instrument. A rule of law that requires the amendment of a transferable document or instrument or provides for certain consequences if a transferable document or instrument is not amended is satisfied with respect to an electronic transferable record if a reliable method is used for amendment of information in the electronic transferable record so that the amended information is identified as such.\nThe new section 16M adopts with modification Article 17 of the Model Law by providing for a change of medium from a transferable document or instrument to\nan electronic transferable record if a reliable method for the change of medium in accordance with that section is used. Such a change of medium has effect only if \u2014\n(a) all the information contained in the transferable document or instrument is accurately reproduced in the electronic transferable record that replaces the transferable document or instrument; and\n(b) a statement indicating a change of medium is inserted in the electronic transferable record that replaces the transferable document or instrument.\nUpon the issuance of the electronic transferable record in accordance with these requirements, the transferable document or instrument (that is being replaced) ceases to have any effect or validity, and must be made inoperative. Normally, this would be done by the provider of the electronic transferable records management system. The new section 16M(4) also clarifies that a change of medium in accordance with the new section 16M(1) and (2) does not affect the rights and obligations of the parties.\nThe new section 16N adopts with modification Article 18 of the Model Law by providing a parallel provision to the new section 16M, for a change of medium from an electronic transferable record to a transferable document or instrument.\nThe new section 16N(3) provides that the requirement that all the information in the electronic transferable record must be accurately reproduced in the replacing transferable document or instrument does not include any additional information that may be contained in an electronic transferable record due to its electronic nature mentioned in the new section 16C, and therefore such additional information need not be included in the replacing transferable document or instrument for the change of medium to take effect.\nThe new section 16O(1) adopts Article 12 of the Model Law by providing a general standard on the assessment of the reliability of each \"reliable method\" mentioned in the new sections 16G, 16H, 16I, 16J, 16L, 16M and 16N. For the purposes of each of these provisions, the method must be as reliable as appropriate for the fulfilment of the function for which the method is being used. The new section 16O(1) further sets out a non-exhaustive list of relevant circumstances for the purpose of assessing the reliability of the method mentioned in those sections.\nThe assessment of the reliability of each relevant method should be carried out separately in light of the function specifically pursued by the use of that method.\nThe new section 16O(2) and (3) (which is not found in the Model Law) also provides that in any proceedings involving an electronic transferable record that is issued, transferred, controlled, presented and stored by means of an accredited electronic transferable records management system provided by a provider that is registered, licensed, accredited or recognised in accordance with regulations made under the new section 16Q, it is presumed, unless evidence to the contrary is\nadduced, that the methods used by the electronic transferable records management system to fulfil the requirements under the new Part IIA in relation to the electronic transferable record are as reliable as appropriate. This presumption applies only if the electronic transferable record is issued, transferred, controlled, presented and stored by means of the accredited electronic transferable records management system provided by the provider during the period in which the provider is registered, licensed, accredited or recognised under the new Part IIA.\nThe new section 16P adopts Article 19 of the Model Law by providing that an electronic transferable record is not to be denied legal effect solely on the ground that it was issued or used outside Singapore. It also provides that the new Part IIA does not affect the application to an electronic transferable record of any rule of private international law governing a transferable document or instrument.\nThe new section 16Q(1) empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of carrying out of the new Part IIA, including regulations for the registration, licensing or accreditation of providers of an electronic transferable records management system and the accreditation of electronic transferable records management systems that satisfy the requirements of providing a reliable method under the new section 16O for the fulfilment of the requirements in relation to an electronic transferable record under that Part. The new section 16Q(2) provides that the Minister may also make regulations to provide for the cross-border recognition of a provider of an electronic transferable records management system that is incorporated, formed or established in a foreign jurisdiction. The foreign provider may be recognised in accordance with such regulations if it is registered, licensed or accredited under a particular registration, licensing or accreditation scheme (as the case may be) established outside\nSingapore, and it carries on its business relating to the electronic transferable records management system in accordance with requirements that are at least equivalent or comparable to the requirements applicable to a provider of an electronic transferable records management system that is or would be registered, licensed or accredited under the new Part IIA. The regulations may provide that a contravention of any specified provision in the regulations is an offence.\nThe new section 16R empowers the Controller to give directions to a provider that is registered, licensed or accredited under the new Part IIA, or any of its officers, employees or authorised representatives, to take specified measures or to stop carrying on specified activities if they are necessary to ensure compliance with that Part.\nThe new section 16S empowers the Controller or an authorised officer to investigate the activities of a provider that is registered, licensed or accredited under the new Part IIA, or any of its officers, employees or authorised representatives, in relation to their compliance with that Part, and to require the production of documents and data for those purposes.\nClause 7 makes a consequential amendment to section 38 (Regulations) to insert a reference to the new section 16Q.\nClause 8 deletes item 2 of the First Schedule.\nClause 9 makes related amendments to sections 1 and 5 of the Bills of Lading\nAct.\nClause 10 makes consequential and related amendments to section 7 of the\nContracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act arising from the amendments to the Bills of\nLading Act.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 41 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (7), the following subsection:\n\"(7A) To avoid doubt \u2014\n(a) a reference to a geographical indication in this section includes a variant constituting a geographical indication; and\n(b) a refusal of registration under this section of any variant constituting a geographical indication does\nnot prevent the registration of any other variant constituting the geographical indication, if that other variant satisfies the requirements of this Act.\".\nAmendment of section 46\n5. Section 46 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \"Any person may\" in subsection (1) and substituting the words \"Subject to subsection (3A), any person may\";\n(b) by deleting the words \"under section 45\" in subsection (1) and substituting the words \"of a geographical indication\nunder section 45 but before the registration of the geographical indication under section 48\";\n(c) by inserting, immediately after the words \"request that a qualification, of\" in subsection (1), the words \"any of\"; and\n(d) by inserting, immediately after subsection\n(3),\nthe\nfollowing subsection:\n\"(3A) A request under subsection (1) may not be made if the request \u2014\n(a) is for a qualification of all the rights conferred under this Act in respect of a\nregistered geographical indication to be entered in the register \u2014\n(i) in relation to any name contained in the geographical indication that is the subject of the application for registration; or\n(ii) in relation to any term which may be a possible translation of the geographical indication that is the subject of the application for registration; and\n(b) is made on the ground that one or more of the exceptions mentioned in section 11(a),\n(b) or (c) or 15 applies to that name or term.\".\nAmendment of section 48\n6. Section 48(1) of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by inserting, immediately after the words \"registration of a geographical indication\", the words \", or of 2 or more variants constituting the same geographical indication,\";\n(b) by inserting, immediately after the words \"all opposition\nproceedings\" in paragraph (b), the words \"in respect of the geographical indication, or in respect of any of those variants,\"; and\n(c) by deleting the words \"shall register the geographical indication\" and substituting the words \"must register the\ngeographical indication, or each variant that is unopposed or in respect of which opposition proceedings are withdrawn or decided in favour of the applicant, as the case may be\".\nNew section 48A\n7. The principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after section 48, the following section:\n\"Application for limitation of scope to be entered in register 48A.\u2014(1) Subject to subsection (4), any person may, at any time after the registration of a geographical indication under\nsection 48, apply to the Court for an order that a limitation of the scope of any of the rights conferred under this Act in respect of a registered geographical indication be entered in the register \u2014\n(a) in relation to any name contained in the registered geographical indication; or\n(b) in relation to any term which may be a possible translation of the registered geographical indication.\n(2) The application under subsection (1) may only be made on either or both of the following grounds:\n(a) that one or more of the exceptions mentioned in\nPart III applies;\n(b) that the term mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is not a translation of the registered geographical indication.\n(3) The application must be made to the Court in the prescribed manner, and must include a statement of the\ngrounds for the application and any other matter that may be prescribed.\n(4) An application under subsection (1) may not be made if the application \u2014\n(a) is for an order that a limitation of the scope of all the\nrights conferred under this Act in respect of a registered geographical indication be entered in the register \u2014\n(i) in relation to any name contained in the registered geographical indication; or\n(ii) in relation to any term which may be a possible translation of the registered geographical indication and which is registered as a variant constituting the registered geographical indication; and\n(b) is made on the ground that one or more of the exceptions mentioned in section 11(a), (b) or (c) or\n15 applies to that name or term.\n(5) The Court, if satisfied that either or both of the grounds\nmentioned in subsection (2) is made out, must order the\nRegistrar to cause to be entered in the register a limitation of the scope of the rights conferred under this Act in relation to any of the following that is applicable:\n(a) any name contained in the registered geographical\nindication;\n(b) any term which is not a translation of the registered geographical indication;\n(c) any term which is a translation of the registered geographical indication.\n(6) Where a registered geographical indication is subject to a limitation of the scope of rights under subsection (5), the rights of an interested party in respect of the geographical indication are restricted accordingly.\n(7) The Minister may make rules as to the entry in the register\nof a limitation of the scope of rights under subsection (5).\".\nAmendment of section 52\n8. Section 52 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by inserting, immediately after the words \"may be cancelled\" in subsection (4)(a), the words \"by the\nRegistrar\"; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after subsection\n(8),\nthe following subsection:\n\"(9) To avoid doubt \u2014\n(a) a reference to a geographical indication in\nthis section includes a variant constituting a geographical indication; and\n(b) a cancellation of the registration under this section of any variant constituting a geographical indication does not affect the registration of any other variant\nconstituting the geographical indication.\".\nTransitional provisions 9.\u2014(1) Section 4 applies to or in relation to any application for registration of a geographical indication, whether made before, on or after the date of commencement of that section.\n(2) Despite section 5, section 46 of the principal Act as in force immediately before the date of commencement of section 5 continues to apply to or in relation to any request that a qualification be entered in the register in respect of a geographical indication, made before the date of commencement of section 5.\n(3) Section 6 applies to or in relation to any application for registration of a geographical indication, whether made before, on or after the date of commencement of that section.\n(4) Section 7 applies to or in relation to any registered geographical indication, whether the geographical indication is registered before,\non or after the date of commencement of that section.\n(5) Section 8 applies to or in relation to any application for the cancellation of the registration of a geographical indication, or of a variant constituting a geographical indication, whether made before, on or after the date of commencement of that section.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Geographical Indications Act 2014 (Act 19 of 2014) (called the GI Act) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to provide that a qualification of the rights conferred under the GI Act in respect of a registered geographical indication \u2014\n(i) may only be requested before a geographical indication is registered; and\n(ii) may not be made if the qualification of rights would render the registration of a name contained in a geographical indication, or a term which may be a possible translation of a geographical indication, nugatory;\n(b) to provide that, after a geographical indication is registered, a person may apply to the High Court for an order that a limitation of the scope of any of the rights conferred under the GI Act in respect of a registered geographical indication be entered in the register;\n(c) to clarify that the grounds for refusal of registration apply in respect of a variant, and that a variant that falls within any of the applicable grounds for refusal of registration may be cancelled.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 to introduce the following definitional provisions:\n(a) \"variant\" is defined as a variant of the indication constituting a geographical indication, and includes any translation, transliteration or other variation of the indication. As an illustration, in the case of a geographical indication known as \"Apples of Singapore\", the terms \"Lion City Apples\" (being a variation) and \"Epal Singapura\" (being a translation) are variants of the geographical indication. To provide another illustration, in the case of a geographical indication known as \"\u4e4c\u654f\u6a59\", the terms \"Ubin Orange\" (being a translation) and \"Wu Min\nCheng\" (being a transliteration) are variants of the geographical indication;\n(b) the new subsection (2) clarifies that 2 or more variants may constitute the same geographical indication;\n(c) the new subsection (3) clarifies that a geographical indication (and each variant, if any) may contain 2 or more words.\nClause 3 amends section 39 (which sets out the procedure for an application for registration of a geographical indication) to clarify that, where a person intends for a variant constituting a geographical indication to be registered and the geographical indication is the subject of an application for registration, the\nperson may include the variant in an application for registration, whether it is the same or a different application for registration of the geographical indication in question.\nClause 4 inserts a new subsection (7A) in section 41 (which sets out grounds for refusal of registration of a geographical indication) to clarify that, where 2 or more variants constitute the same geographical indication, any of the variants constituting the geographical indication must not be registered if the variant falls within an applicable ground for refusal of registration specified in that section. To avoid doubt, a refusal of registration of a variant does not prevent any other variant of the geographical indication from being registered if that other variant satisfies the requirements of the GI Act.\nThe new subsection (7A) does not represent a substantive change of position, but expressly sets out the requirement that each variant (which is sought to be registered) must satisfy the requirements of the GI Act in order to be registered.\nClause 5 amends section 46 to provide that a request to enter a qualification of any of the rights conferred under the GI Act in respect of a registered geographical indication in the register may only be made in respect of a geographical indication before the geographical indication is registered under section 48.\nIn addition, a new subsection (3A) is inserted in section 46 to provide that a request may not be made if the qualification of rights would render registration of a name contained in a geographical indication or a term which may be a possible translation of a geographical indication nugatory. In particular, the request may not be made if the request is for a qualification of all the rights conferred under the\nGI Act on a registered geographical indication to be entered in the register in relation to the name or term on the ground that one or more of the exceptions mentioned in section 11(a), (b) or (c) or 15 applies to that name or term. In such a case, instead of making a request to enter a qualification of rights in the register under section 46, notice of opposition to the registration of the geographical indication or variant constituting the geographical indication under section 45 should be given.\nClause 6 amends section 48 to provide that, where 2 or more variants constitute the same geographical indication, the Registrar of Geographical Indications must register a variant if the application for registration of the variant \u2014\n(a) is accepted under section 43(6); and\n(b) is unopposed, or in respect of which opposition proceedings are withdrawn or decided in favour of the applicant for registration of the variant.\nThis is so even though one or more other variants of the geographical indication is subject to opposition proceedings or is refused registration. This amendment\nclarifies that each variant must satisfy the requirements of the GI Act in order to be registered, and does not reflect a substantive change of position.\nClause 7 inserts a new section 48A to provide that, after the date of registration of a geographical indication, any person may apply to the High Court for an order that a limitation of the scope of the rights conferred under the GI Act in respect of a registered geographical indication be entered in the register in relation to any name contained in the registered geographical indication, or in relation to any term which may be a possible translation of the registered geographical indication. The application may only be made on the ground that one or more of the exceptions under Part III applies, or (in the case of a term which may be a possible translation of the registered geographical indication) that the term is not a translation of the geographical indication.\nThe application under the new section 48A may not be made if the effect of the order that a limitation of scope be entered in the register is to render registration of the name or term nugatory. In particular, the application may not be made if the application for an order that a limitation of the scope of all the rights conferred under the GI Act in respect of a registered geographical indication be entered in the register is made on the ground that one or more of the exceptions mentioned in section 11(a), (b) or (c) or 15 applies to that name or term. In such a case, instead of making an application for an order to enter a limitation of scope in the register under the new section 48A, an application for cancellation of the geographical indication or variant constituting the geographical indication under section 52 should be made.\nClause 8 amends section 52 (which sets out the circumstances in which the registration of a geographical indication may be cancelled) to clarify that, where 2 or more variants constitute the same geographical indication, the registration of any of the variants may be cancelled if any applicable ground set out in the section is satisfied in respect of the variant. These amendments do not reflect a substantive change of position but clarify that an application may be made for the cancellation of only one (or more) of the variants registered under the GI Act. Cancellation of the registration of a variant constituting a geographical indication does not affect any rights in respect of the registration of any other variant constituting that geographical indication.\nClause 9 contains transitional provisions.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

or\n(b) before that date \u2014\n(i) in the case of a supply of goods \u2014\n(A) if the goods are to be removed, no goods were removed or only a part of the goods were removed; or\n(B) if the goods are not to be removed, no goods are made available or only a part of the goods were\nmade available to the person to whom they are supplied; or\n(ii) in the case of a supply of services, no services were performed or only a part of the services were performed,\ntax shall be chargeable at the rate applicable on that date on the amount of the invoice less the higher of the following amounts:\n(c) any part consideration received before that date; or\n(d) the value of any goods removed or made available, or any services performed, as the case may be, before that date.\n(8) For the purpose of subsection (7), an invoice referred to in that subsection shall, on the date the supply ceases to be a zero-rated or an exempt supply, cease to have effect to the extent of the amount on which tax is chargeable under subsection (7).\n(9) Where an invoice that ceases to have effect under subsection (8) is a tax invoice, the person making the supply shall issue a new tax invoice specifying \u2014\n(a) the tax rate applicable on the date the supply ceases to be a zero-rated or an exempt supply; and\n(b) the amount on which tax is chargeable at that tax rate under subsection (7), and tax shall be chargeable on the supply to which the new invoice relates as if it were a separate supply.\n(10) Regulations made under section 41 may, in relation to any tax invoice which \u2014\n(a) relates to a supply in respect of which an election is made under this section and which was issued before the election was made; or\n(b) ceases to have effect under subsection (4) or (8), provide for the replacement or correction of that invoice (including the issue of a credit note).\n(11) No election may be made under this section in respect of a supply to which paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule applies.\n(12) For the purposes of this section, where only a part of the goods are removed or made available, or only a part of the services are performed, as the case may be, the value of the supply so partly made shall be such value as is, in the opinion of the Comptroller, reasonably attributable to the supply so partly made.\n(13) In this section \u2014 \"new tax rate\" means the tax rate applicable on the date an increase in tax rate comes into operation; \"old tax rate\" means the tax rate applicable immediately before the date an increase in tax rate comes into operation.\".\nAmendment of section 41\n13. Section 41 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the word \"and\" at the end of subsection (1)(a);\n(b) by deleting the full-stop at the end of paragraph (b) of subsection\n(1) and substituting the word \"; and\", and by inserting immediately thereafter the following paragraph:\n\"(c) provide for the circumstances in which a document by a taxable person purporting to be a tax invoice in respect of a supply of goods or services to him by another taxable person, is to be treated as a tax invoice required under paragraph (b) to be provided by the taxable person supplying the goods or services.\"; and\n(c) by deleting subsection (7) and substituting the following subsections:\n\"(7) At the end of a prescribed accounting period \u2014\n(a) the amount of tax due from any person that is his output tax after deduction of input tax allowable under section 20; or\n(b) the amount due to any person under section 19(5), as the case may be, shall be zero if the amount is less than $5 or such other amount as the Minister may by order prescribe.\n(8) At the end of a prescribed accounting period, the amount of tax due from a person that is tax accounted for by him pursuant to regulations made under section 27A shall be nil if\nit is less than $5 or such other amount as the Minister may by order prescribe.\".\nAmendment of section 42\n14. Section 42 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \"an electronic service for \u2014\" in subsection\n(1) and substituting the words \"for the following to be effected electronically:\";\n(b) by deleting the words \"any return, declaration or document\" in subsections (1)(b), (3)(b), (4)(b), (5), (6), (8)(a), (9)(a) and (13)(b) and substituting in each case the words \"any return, declaration, document, application or information\";\n(c) by deleting the words \"the electronic service\" wherever they appear in subsections (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8)(a) and (i), (9)(a), (10)(c), (12) and (13)(a), (b), and (c) and substituting in each case the words \"an electronic service\";\n(d) by deleting the words \"the return, declaration or document\" in subsections (6)(a) and (b) and (9) and substituting in each case the words \"the return, declaration, document, application or information\";\n(e) by inserting, immediately after the word \"declaration,\" in subsections (10)(a)(i) and (ii) and (11), the words \"application, information,\"; and\n(f) by inserting, immediately after subsection (13), the following subsection:\n\"(14) In this section, \"electronic service\" means any service established or approved by the Comptroller for any or all of the purposes in subsection (1).\".\nAmendment of section 59\n15. Section 59 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by inserting, immediately after the words \"output tax\" in subsection (1)(a), the words \"or any tax that is accountable pursuant to regulations made under section 27A\"; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after the words \"output tax\" in subsection (2)(a), the words \"or any tax that is accountable pursuant to regulations made under section 27A\".\nAmendment of section 60\n16. Section 60 of the principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (1), the following subsection:\n\"(1A) Subsection (1) shall apply separately to \u2014\n(a) the output tax of a taxable person after deduction of input tax allowable under section 20; and\n(b) tax accountable by a taxable person pursuant to regulations made under section 27A.\".\nAmendment of Third Schedule\n17. The Third Schedule to the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting paragraphs 2 and 6;\n(b) by deleting the words \"or in the case of the import of goods at the rate of exchange determined by the Director-General of\nCustoms at the time applicable under the Customs Act (Cap. 70) for the calculation of customs or excise duties and valuation\" in paragraph 11(1);\n(c) by deleting the words \"approved exclusively for residential purposes under the Planning Act (Cap. 232)\" in paragraph 13 and substituting the words \"which is used or to be used principally for residential purposes\"; and\n(d) by renumbering paragraph 13 as sub-paragraph (1) of that paragraph, and by inserting immediately thereafter the following sub-paragraph:\n\"(2) For the purpose of sub-paragraph (1), the Minister may, by order published in the Gazette, provide that any building, flat or tenement is to be included, or is not to be included, as a building, flat or tenement used or to be used principally for residential purposes.\".\nAmendment of Fourth Schedule\n18. The Fourth Schedule to the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 2 and substituting the following sub-paragraph:\n\"(c) any land or part thereof with any building, flat or tenement thereon, being a building, flat or tenement which is used or to be used principally for residential purposes.\";\n(b) by deleting sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 4(3) and substituting the following sub-paragraph:\n\"(c) any building, flat or tenement which is not used or to be used principally for residential purposes.\"; and\n(c) by inserting, immediately after sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 4, the following sub-paragraph:\n\"(4) For the purpose of paragraphs 2(c) and 4(3)(c), the Minister may, by order published in the Gazette, provide that any building, flat or tenement is to be included, or is not to be included, as a building, flat or tenement used or to be used principally for residential purposes.\".\nSavings and transitional provision\n19. For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of this section, the Minister may, by regulations published in the Gazette, prescribe such provisions of a savings or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of this Act, as he may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A) (\"the Act\").\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClauses 2 to 18 amend the Act for the following purposes:\n(a) Import and extent of goods and services tax (\"tax\")\n(i) Changes to the rules on the time of supply [main amendments at clause 3, consequential amendments at clauses 11, 12 and 13(a) and (b)]\n(ii) Changes to the rules on the value of supply in relation to imported goods [main amendment at clause 4, consequential amendments at clauses 2 and 17(a) and (b)]\n(iii) Changes to clarify the rules on the value of supplies in special cases [clause 17(c) and (d)]\n(iv) Changes to clarify the rules on exempt supplies involving premises used for residential purposes [clause 18]\n(b) Reliefs\n(i) Changes to the zero-rating of international services in relation to the marine industry [clause 6]\n(ii) Introduction of a new Import Goods and Services Tax Deferment\nScheme (IGDS) [main amendment at clause 8, consequential amendments at clauses 5, 13(c), 15 and 16]\nSpecial cases\n(i) Changes to clarify the rules relating to supplies of goods in free trade zones and warehouses [clause 9]\n(d) Miscellaneous changes\n(i) Changes to clarify provisions for the Margin Scheme [clause 7]\n(ii) Changes to enhance the Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader\nScheme (ACMT) [clause 10]\n(iii) Changes to enhance the provisions relating to the electronic service [clause 14]\nClause 19 is a savings and transitional provision.\nPart 1 \u2014 Time of supply\nCurrently, sections 11 and 12 of the Act provide the rules for determining when a supply of goods or services is treated as taking place for the purposes of the \"charge to tax\". Section 11 provides for the basic tax point as follows:\n(a) a supply of goods is treated as taking place \u2014\n(i) if the goods are to be removed, at the time of the removal;\n(ii) if the goods are not to be removed, at the time when they are made available to the person to whom they are supplied;\n(iii) if the goods (being sent or taken on approval or sale or return or similar terms) are removed before it is known whether a supply will take place, at the time when it becomes certain that the supply has taken place or\n12 months after the removal, whichever is the earlier; and\n(b) a supply of services is treated as taking place at the time when the services are performed.\nUnder section 12, the basic tax point can be altered to an actual tax point as a result of the issue of an invoice or the payment of consideration, or otherwise in accordance with directions given by the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax (the Comptroller) or regulations made by the Minister charged with the responsibility for finance (the\nMinister).\nThe rules for determining when a supply of goods or services is treated as taking place are to be simplified such that the time of supply will primarily be determined in accordance with when an invoice is issued or consideration is received for the supply, whichever is the earlier.\nMain amendment\nClause 3 repeals the existing sections 11 and 12 and substitutes new sections 11, 11A, 11B, 12 and 12A.\nThe new section 11(1) provides that the new sections 11 to 12A will apply in determining the time when a supply takes place for all purposes of the Act.\nAccordingly, where a supply would, under the new time of supply rules be treated as taking place after a person is, or becomes liable to be, registered under the Act, the supply is chargeable to tax even though the supply may, apart from the new time of supply rules, take place before the person is, or becomes liable to be, so registered.\nThe new section 11(2) provides for the primary test by which the time of supply is to be determined.\nThe new section 11(3) provides for certain instances in which the primary test will not be used. Instead, the new section 11(3) and (4) provides for an alternative test, viz.\nthe earliest of the following:\n(a) when an invoice is issued;\n(b) when consideration is received; and\n(c) when \u2014\n(i) in the case of a supply of goods \u2014\n(A) if the goods are to be removed, the goods are removed; or\n(B) if the goods are not to be removed, the goods are made available; or\n(ii) in the case of a supply of services, the services are performed.\nThe instances in which this alternative test will be used are \u2014\n(a) where the supply is of goods consisting of the grant, assignment or surrender of any interest in or right over land (other than grants of tenancies and leases);\n(b) where the supply is made by a taxpayer who has applied to the Comptroller to be allowed to use the alternative test and the Comptroller has allowed his application; and\n(c) where the supply is of goods made by an agent who is treated under section 33(2) as having supplied the goods as principal.\nThe new section 11(5) provides that the Comptroller may treat any invoice issued by a recipient of goods or services as an invoice issued by the supplier thereof in determining the time when the supply of the goods or services takes place for the purposes of the Act. This provides for situations where the supplier does not issue an invoice.\nThe new section 11A provides for specific tests to be applied notwithstanding anything in the new section 11 (whether the new section 11(2), or the new section 11(3) and (4)) except to such extent as may be specified in the new section 11A.\nThe new section 11A(2) makes it clear that, for the purpose of determining a person's liability to be registered, the test for determining the time of supply will be the primary test (even though at the time of the supply under the primary test, the person is not a taxable person).\nThe new section 11A(3) provides that the primary test is to apply to supplies made to a taxable person prior to his becoming a taxable person, or, in the case of a taxable person that is a body corporate, prior to the incorporation of the body corporate, for the purpose of allowing the taxable person to count the tax on that supply to him as his input tax.\nThe new section 11A(4) and (5) provides for the test to be applied in the case of transfers or disposals of the assets of a business, or where the assets are put to private or non-business use.\nThe new section 11A(6) provides for the test to be applied in the case of a supply of goods where, at the time the goods are removed, it is not known whether there will be a supply of the goods.\nThe new section 11B provides for specific tests to be applied notwithstanding anything in the new section 11(2).\nWhere the new section 11(2) applies, and as a result of the new section 11(1), if a person is, or is required to be, registered under the Act, his supplies are chargeable to tax if the invoice for the supply is issued and consideration is received for the supply on or after the date the person is, or is required to be, registered under the Act. This is notwithstanding that the goods (if they are to be removed) were removed or (if they are not to be removed) were made available, or the services were performed, as the case may be, prior to that date. However, the new section 11B(2) requires the person to treat the supply as nevertheless having taken place prior to his being registered or being\n31\nrequired to be registered so as not to be chargeable to tax, if the person to whom the supply is made (being a person who is not entitled under sections 19 and 20 to credit for the whole or any part of tax on the supply) so requests.\nThe new section 11B(3) provides for a supply between connected persons to be treated as taking place 12 months after the goods (if they are to be removed) have been removed or (if they are not to be removed) have been made available, or services have been performed, as the case may be, if no invoice is issued or consideration received during that period. This provision is an anti-avoidance measure and the Minister may, under the new section 11B(4), make regulations to prescribe the supplies that may be excluded from the application of the new section 11B(3).\nThe new section 11B(5) provides that, where goods or services are provided under a financing arrangement which amounts to a supply of financial services referred to in paragraph 1 of the Fourth Schedule and the financial services provide for payment by instalments, the supply of the goods or services will be treated as wholly taking place when the invoice for the first instalment under the financing arrangement is issued or the first such instalment paid. The time of supply of the financial services will fall to be determined in accordance with the new section 11.\nThe new section 11B(6) provides for the test for determining when a supply is to be treated as having taken place in relation to a taxable person that becomes de-registered.\nUnder the new subsection, where, pursuant to a supply of goods or services \u2014\n(a) goods (if they are to be removed) are removed or (if they are not to be removed) are made available, or services are performed, as the case may be, before the taxable person becomes de-registered;\n(b) the taxable person then becomes de-registered; and\n(c) the invoice for those goods or services is issued or consideration for those goods or services is received on or after the person is de-registered, the supply of those goods or services will be treated as having been made on the day immediately prior to the day the person becomes de-registered so as to be chargeable to\ntax.\nThe new section 11B(7) provides that the new section 11B(2), (3), (5) and (6) will not apply in relation to \u2014\n(a) any supply of goods referred to in the new section 11(3)(a) or (c); or\n(b) any supply of goods or services made by a person whose application has been allowed by the Comptroller under the new section 11(3)(b).\nThe new section 12(1) empowers the Comptroller to give directions to vary the time of supply as provided for in the tests set out in the new sections 11, 11A and 11B if so requested by the taxpayer. This provision currently exists as section 12(5).\nThe new section 12(2)(a) empowers the Minister to make regulations to vary the time of supply as provided for in the tests set out in the new sections 11, 11A and 11B.\nThe new section 12(2)(a) currently exists as section 12(8)(a), (b) and (d) (regulations currently made under the existing section 12(8)(c) will be replaced by the new\nsection 11A(5)). The new section 12(2)(b) additionally empowers the Minister to make regulations to provide for when consideration for a supply will be regarded as having been received, depending on the type of consideration and the manner in which it is provided.\nThe new section 12(3) currently exists as section 12(9).\nThe new section 12A is a transitional provision. It provides for the existing sections\n11 and 12 to continue to apply in certain circumstances.\nConsequential amendments\nClauses 11, 12 and 13(a) and (b) amend section 38 (Customers to account for tax on certain supplies), repeal and re-enact section 39 (Supplies spanning change of rate, etc.) and amend section 41 (Accounting for and payment of tax), respectively, to make consequential amendments arising from the new sections 11, 11A, 11B and 12 inserted by clause 3. The amendment made by clause 13(a) and (b) takes into account the deletion of the existing section 12(4) by clause 3.\nPart 2 \u2014 Value of imported goods\nUnder section 8 of the Act, tax on the importation of goods is \"charged, levied and payable as if it were customs duty or excise duty and as if all goods imported into\nSingapore are dutiable and liable to customs duty or excise duty\". Under section 10 of the Customs Act (Cap. 70), customs duty and excise duty is \"charged, levied and paid ... on [certain] goods imported into the customs territory or manufactured in\nSingapore\". Under section 3(1) of the Customs Act, \"customs territory\" is defined as meaning \"Singapore and the territorial waters thereof but excluding any free trade zone\".\nUnder section 27 of the Customs Act (Cap. 70), customs duty and excise duty must, in general, be paid before the goods can be removed from customs control. Under section 3(2) of the Customs Act, goods are \"deemed to be under customs control while they are deposited or held in any free trade zone, Government warehouse, licensed warehouse, or bottling warehouse or post office or in any vessel, train, vehicle or aircraft or any place from which they may not be removed except with the permission of the proper officer of customs\". Goods are under customs control outside the customs territory if they are in a free trade zone, and are under customs control in the customs territory if they are in any place referred to in section 3(2) of the Customs Act that is not in a free trade zone.\nMain amendment\nClause 4 repeals and re-enacts section 18 to bring the test for determining the value of imported goods for the purposes of tax in line with that generally used for determining the value of goods for the purposes of customs duty and excise duty (currently, the test adopted in relation to both customs duty and excise duty is the same). This is provided for in the new section 18(1)(a).\nFor purposes of tax, however, regard must also be had to any increase in value of the goods as a result of their being supplied in Singapore prior to the tax on their importation being paid. This is provided for in the new section 18(1)(b).\nIn the case of both paragraphs (a) and (b) of the new section 18(1), the value of the imported goods must also include any tax, duty or other charge levied outside or, by reason of importation, within Singapore (other than any goods and services tax). In the case of paragraph (b) of the new section 18(1), for the avoidance of doubt, the value of the goods must also include all costs by way of commission, packing, transport and insurance and all other costs, charges and expenses incidental to the sale and delivery of the goods up to the port or place of importation.\nThe new section 18(2) expands the concept of \"customs control\" so as to cover goods to which the concept of \"customs control\" under the Customs Act would not apply on the basis that the goods are not subject to customs duty or excise duty under that Act.\nConsequential amendments\nClauses 2 and 17(a) and (b) delete part of the definition of \"open market value\" in section 2(1), and paragraphs 2 and 6 and a part of paragraph 11(1) of the Third\nSchedule, respectively, which are no longer required as a result of the new section 18 inserted by clause 4.\nPart 3 \u2014 Value of supplies in special cases\nCurrently, paragraph 13 of the Third Schedule (Valuation \u2014 Special Cases) refers to buildings, flats and tenements being \"approved exclusively for residential purposes under the Planning Act (Cap. 232)\".\nClause 17(c) amends paragraph 13 in the Third Schedule to clarify that the paragraph applies in relation to buildings, flats and tenements \"used or to be used principally for residential purposes\". Buildings, flats and tenements are treated as being used or to be used principally for residential purposes if there is some permanency to the use or proposed use of those premises for purposes of accommodation by a person and the purpose of accommodation is the main purpose. Examples would be premises used as the home or dwelling place of a person. Clause 17(d) empowers the Minister to provide, by order published in the Gazette, what may be included as buildings, flats and tenements used or to be used principally for residential purposes, and what will not be treated as buildings, flats and tenements used or to be used principally for residential purposes. This is to provide clarity, particularly where there may be doubt as to whether there is sufficient permanency in the use of premises for purposes of accommodation, or whether the purpose of accommodation is the main purpose.\nPart 4 \u2014 Exempt supplies in relation to premises used for residential purposes\nClause 18(a) and (b) makes the same amendments to paragraphs 2 and 4 of the\nFourth Schedule (Exempt Supplies), respectively, as clause 17(c) makes to paragraph\n13 of the Third Schedule, for the same reasons. Clause 18(c) gives the same power to the Minister in relation to the Fourth Schedule as clause 17(d) gives in relation to the\nThird Schedule.\nPart 5 \u2014 Zero-rating: marine industry\nClause 6 makes various amendments to section 21 (Zero-rating for exports and international services) to provide for the enhancements to the zero-rating of supplies in connection with the marine industry.\nClause 6(a) deletes sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection (3)(a), which currently refer to transportation \u2014 \"(i) from a place outside Singapore to another place outside Singapore;\n(ii) from a place in Singapore to a place outside Singapore; or\n(iii) from a place outside Singapore to a place in Singapore\".\nNew sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) are substituted therefor. The new sub-paragraph (i) comprises the current sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) for the purposes of transportation by air and land. For the purposes of transportation by sea, the new sub-paragraph (ii)(A) is the same as the existing sub-paragraph (i), and the new sub-paragraph (ii)(B) replaces the existing sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) with transportation by sea that is \u2014 \"(ii)(B) from a place in Singapore or to a place in Singapore, and substantially outside Singapore\".\nThe new sub-paragraph not only covers the existing sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) (transportation by sea that is from a place in Singapore to a place outside Singapore, or vice versa, would invariably be substantially outside Singapore), but also includes other trips such as \"round-trips\" (that is, trips that begin and end in Singapore), if the trips are substantially outside Singapore (for instance, \"cruises to nowhere\").\nClause 6(b) makes a consequential amendment to subsection (3)(b) arising from the amendment to section 21(3)(a) by clause 6(a).\nClause 6(c) makes a technical as well as a consequential amendment to subsection (4). The technical amendment is the inclusion of the reference to subsection (6) as the definitions in subsection (4) are relevant to subsection (6). The consequential amendment is the inclusion of subsections (6A) and (6B), inserted by clause 6(f), for which the definitions in subsection (4) are also relevant.\nClause 6(d) deletes and substitutes the definition of \"ship\" in subsection (4)(a) to enlarge the current definition to include ships that are designed or adapted for use for recreation or pleasure. However, such ships must only be used outside of Singapore (for this purpose, any use in Singapore that is incidental to the use outside Singapore \u2014 for instance, any travel into or out of Singapore, and any temporary stay in Singapore, as part of an itinerary that is otherwise outside Singapore \u2014 will be disregarded as the\nComptroller may allow). The exclusion of ships designed or adapted for use for recreation or pleasure and so used in Singapore is set out in paragraph (iii) of the new definition of \"ship\". The exclusion at paragraph (i) of the new definition is an existing exclusion and the exclusion at paragraph (ii) is a new exclusion that takes into consideration vessel permits issued by the Public Utilities Board for vessels permitted to be used in reservoirs and catchment areas.\nClause 6(e) amends subsection (6) (which deals with the zero-rating of the supply of goods) by deleting paragraph (b) of that subsection (6) and substituting a new paragraph (b). The new paragraph (b) is the same as the existing one except that the new paragraph (b) is limited in its application to aircraft (because the zero-rating of supplies relating to goods (both sale and rental) in relation to ships is set out in the new subsections (6A) and (6B) inserted by clause 6(f)), and further clarifies that it includes goods used as fuel on an aircraft.\nClause 6(f) inserts new subsections (6A) and (6B).\nThe new subsection (6A) provides for the zero-rating of supplies relating to goods (both sale and rental) in relation to ships if the goods are for use as stores or fuel on a ship or if the goods are for sale by retail as merchandise to persons carried on a ship.\nAdditionally, the new subsection (6A) provides that supplies relating to goods in relation to ships are zero-rated if the goods are for installation on a ship (including if it is a ship under construction) or the goods are for use in the maintenance or operation of a ship.\nThe new subsection (6B) limits the application of the new subsection (6A) in relation to ships designed for use for recreation or pleasure (that come within the new definition of \"ship\" inserted by clause 6(d)). Supplies of goods in relation to such ships will be zero-rated only if the Comptroller is satisfied that the goods are used outside of\nSingapore.\nClause 6(g) and (h) makes consequential amendments to subsection (8) arising from the new subsections (6A) and (6B) inserted by clause 6(f).\nPart 6 \u2014 IGDS\nA new scheme is being introduced: the Import Goods and Services Tax Deferment\nScheme (IGDS). Under the IGDS, goods that have been imported into Singapore may be removed from customs control without payment of tax chargeable on the importation of the goods, and the tax will be paid at a later point in time.\nUnder the IGDS, the tax (IGDS tax) will have to be accounted for and paid in the same manner that output tax is currently accounted for and paid. In section 19(3)(b), output tax is defined as \"tax on supplies which a taxable person makes\". The accounting for and payment of such tax is provided for under regulations made under section 41. So as not to make any changes to the concept of output tax as it currently exists, the IGDS tax is to be accounted for and paid as a component separate from output tax, and not as part of output tax. However, the IGDS tax may still be claimed as input tax and netted off against output tax in certain circumstances. In section 19(3)(a), input tax is defined, in relation to a taxable person, as \u2014 \"(i) tax on the supply to him of any goods or services; and\n(ii) tax paid or payable by him on the importation of any goods, being (in either case) goods or services used or to be used for the purpose of any business carried on or to be carried on by him\".\nMain amendment\nClause 8 inserts a new section 27A to provide for the IGDS.\nThe new section 27A(1) empowers the Minister to make regulations to permit goods imported by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of any business carried on by him to be delivered or removed notwithstanding that tax chargeable on the importation of the goods is not paid.\nThe new section 27A(2) provides that the Minister may make regulations to require a taxable person to account for and pay the IGDS tax in such form and manner, and within such time and to such person, as may be prescribed.\nThe new section 27A(3) empowers the Comptroller to impose conditions in relation to the import of goods referred to in the new section 27A(1) for the protection of revenue.\nThe new section 27A(4) empowers the Comptroller to publish the names and such other particulars of taxable persons under the IGDS as the Comptroller thinks fit.\nConsequential amendments\nClause 5 makes various consequential amendments to section 19 (Credit for input tax against output tax) arising from the new section 27A inserted by clause 8.\nClause 5(a) inserts a new subsection (3A) to provide that the IGDS tax cannot be treated as input tax until such time as it is in fact accounted for pursuant to regulations made under the new section 27A.\nClause 5(b) makes a consequential amendment to subsection (5) arising from the new subsection (5A) inserted by clause 5(c).\nClause 5(c) inserts a new subsection (5A) to provide that any refund that the\nComptroller is liable to pay to a taxpayer after the input tax of the taxable person has been netted off against the output tax of the taxable person (as provided for in subsection (5)), is to be reduced by the amount of the IGDS tax that has been accounted\nfor.\nClause 13(c) makes a consequential amendment to section 41 (Accounting for and payment of tax) arising from the new section 27A inserted by clause 8 by deleting the existing subsection (7) and substituting new subsections (7) and (8).\nThe new subsection (7) makes it clear that, where the amount of a person's output tax is, after deduction of any refund due to the person under section 19(5), less than $5 or such other prescribed amount, the amount will be treated as zero. The new subsection (8) provides that where the amount of the IGDS tax accounted for by a taxable person is less than $5 or such other prescribed amount, it will be treated as zero.\nThe new subsections preserve the differentiation between a person's output tax and his\nIGDS tax.\nClause 15 makes consequential amendments to section 59 (Penalty for incorrect return) arising from the new section 27A inserted by clause 8. Currently, section 59(1)(a) and (2)(a) refers to any person who \u2014\n\"(a) makes an incorrect return by omitting or understating any output tax or by overstating any input tax of which he is required by this Act to make a return\".\nClause 15 inserts a reference to the IGDS tax after the reference to output tax in both subsections (1)(a) and (2)(a) of section 59 to extend the application of section 59 to the\nIGDS tax.\nClause 16 makes a consequential amendment to section 60 (Penalty for failure to pay or make returns within prescribed period) arising from the new section 27A inserted by clause 8. Clause 16 inserts a new subsection (1A) to make it clear that the penalty of \"5% of the amount of tax payable\" applies to output tax (after deduction of input tax) and the IGDS tax separately, in other words, 5% in respect of the amount of output tax (after deduction of input tax) payable, and 5% in respect of the amount of the\nIGDS tax payable.\nPart 7 \u2014 Supplies of goods in free trade zones and warehouses\nCurrently, under section 37(1) and (2), where supplies of goods relate to goods brought into Singapore and the supplies take place whilst the goods are in certain warehouses or, by virtue of the existing section 37(7), in the free trade zone, all such supplies are disregarded except the last supply. Under the existing section 37(2B), the goods will be regarded as remaining in those warehouses if they are removed for purposes of any auction, exhibition or similar event involving the display of goods and returned to any of those warehouses upon the conclusion of that event.\nClause 9 repeals and re-enacts section 37 to clarify the conceptual basis for the tax treatment of supplies of goods in the free trade zones and certain warehouses. Under the new section 37, reference is no longer made to the goods being subject to a warehousing regime or being in a free trade zone, but to being under customs control.\nThis is because customs control, already in existence in the Customs Act (Cap. 70) (see under Part 2 of this Explanatory Statement) is a concept that covers goods in warehouses relevant to the scheme and free trade zones, as well as the movement of goods between such places.\nThe new section 37(1) provides that, where goods are brought into Singapore under customs control, all supplies of such goods will be disregarded so long as those supplies involve \u2014\n(a) the goods being removed from a place under such customs control, whether to another place under such customs control or out of such customs control; or\n(b) the goods being made available whilst under such customs control.\nThe new section 37(1) will apply only in relation to goods brought in from outside\nSingapore under customs control and which remain under such customs control.\nAccordingly, regard must be had to the origin of the goods.\nThe new section 37(1) does not deal with tax on the importation of the goods, which will continue to be levied, charged and paid in accordance with the other provisions of the Act.\nThe new section 37(2) provides that, where goods are produced or manufactured whilst under customs control in a certain place in the customs territory, or such goods are mixed, whilst still under such customs control, with goods that have been imported, all supplies of such goods will be disregarded so long as those supplies involve \u2014\n(a) the goods being removed from a place under such customs control; or\n(b) the goods being made available whilst under such customs control, other than the last of such supplies. Accordingly, the effect of the new subsection (2) is to impose tax on the last supply.\nThe new section 37(3) provides that, where imported goods are used to produce or manufacture other goods while under customs control in a certain place in the customs territory, and there is no supply of the other goods as referred to in that subsection, the imported goods are treated as being removed from customs control when the other goods are produced or manufactured. Tax on the importation of the imported goods is payable at the time the other goods are so removed.\nThe new section 37(4) essentially provides for matters covered by the existing section 37(2B).\nThe new section 37(5) empowers the Minister to make regulations for matters in connection with the new section 37. This provision currently exists as section 37(3).\nThe new section 37(6) expands the concept of \"customs control\" so as to cover goods to which the concept of \"customs control\" under the Customs Act (Cap. 70) would not apply on the basis that the goods are not subject to customs duty or excise duty under that Act.\nThe new section 37(7) defines terms used in the new section 37.\nPart 8 \u2014 Margin scheme\nClause 7 deletes the section heading of \"Relief on supply of certain secondhand goods\" for section 23, and substitutes a new section heading to better describe the purpose of the section.\nPart 9 \u2014 ACMT\nClause 10 makes various amendments to section 37A (Treatment or processing of goods for and to a person belonging in a country other than Singapore) to enhance the\nACMT scheme provided for therein. Under the ACMT scheme, a local taxable person makes a supply to an overseas person comprising the treatment or processing of goods.\nThe overseas person makes a supply of the treated or processed goods to his customer.\nClause 10(a) amends subsection (1) to clarify that the supply comprising the treatment or processing of goods is a supply \u2014\n(a) made under a contract with a person who belongs outside of Singapore and is not a registered person; and\n(b) which directly benefits a person who belongs outside Singapore and is not a registered person.\nAs is the case with section 21(3)(j), (k) and (s), the first person referred to can be the same as the second person referred to, or the 2 persons can be different persons.\nClause 10(b) deletes subsection (2) and substitutes new subsections (2) and (3).\nThe new subsection (2) enhances the regulation-making power of the Minister as follows:\n(a) the new subsection (2)(a) empowers the Minister to make regulations for purposes of anti-avoidance;\n(b) the new subsection (2)(b) replaces the regulation-making provision in the existing subsection (2) and clarifies that a taxable person under the ACMT scheme need only declare his receipt of treated or processed goods, and not account for tax as if there were supplies to and by him of the same;\n(c) the new subsection (2)(c) empowers the Minister to make regulations for the taxable person under the ACMT scheme who delivers the treated or processed goods to the customer of the overseas person to be substituted for the overseas person in accounting for and paying tax on the supply of the goods to the customer of the overseas person.\nThe new subsection (3) empowers the Comptroller to publish the names and such other particulars of taxable persons under the ACMT scheme as the Comptroller thinks\nfit.\nClause 10(c) makes a consequential amendment to the section heading of section 37A arising from the amendment by clause 10(a).\nPart 10 \u2014 Electronic service\nClause 14 makes various amendments to section 42 (Electronic service). The amendments enhance the provisions of section 42 as the electronic service is no longer simply used for the filing of returns, but also allows for the making of applications for refunds under the Tourist Refund Scheme (This scheme is set out in Part VII of the\nGoods and Services Tax (General) Regulations (Rg 1)).\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires \u2014 \"disclose\", in relation to identifying information that is a personal identifier, includes providing access to the identifying information; \"identifying information\" means \u2014\n(a) any personal identifier;\n(b) any meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier;\n(c) any record of a result of analysing any personal identifier or meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier; and\n(d) any other information, derived from any personal identifier or meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier, or from any record of a kind referred to in paragraph (c), that could be used to discover a particular person's identity or to get information about a particular person.\nAuthorising disclosure of or access to identifying information 36B.\u23af(1) The\nMinister may, in writing, authorise a specified person, or any person included in a specified class of persons \u2014\nFirst column\nSecond column\n(a) to access identifying information of the kind specified in the\nMinister's authorisation; or\n(b) to disclose, on written request, identifying information of the kind specified in the\nMinister's authorisation, to another specified person, or another person included in a specified class of persons, in the Minister's authorisation, for the purpose or purposes specified in the\nMinister's authorisation.\n(2) The\nMinister shall specify in an authorisation under this section, as the purpose or purposes for which access or disclosure is authorised, one or more of the following purposes, and no other:\n(a) combating document and identity fraud in immigration matters;\n(b) assisting in the identification of, and authenticating the identity of, any person who may be required by or under this Act to provide a personal identifier;\n(c) improving the efficiency and integrity of immigration processing at authorised landing places, airports, train checkpoints or points of entry;\n(d) assisting in the identification of, and authenticating the identity of, any applicant for or holder of a Singapore visa, and facilitating his entry into Singapore;\n(e) enforcement of the criminal law, including investigating or prosecuting a person for an offence against any written law;\n(f) administering or managing the storage of identifying information;\n(g) modifying identifying information to enable it to be matched with other identifying information, or in order to correct errors or ensure compliance with appropriate standards;\nFirst column\nSecond column\n(h) identifying non-citizens who are prohibited immigrants, who are of national security concern or who are associated with activities of a criminal nature and whose detention or supervision may be necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order;\n(i) making decisions under this Act, or under the Passports Act 2007 or the regulations made under either Act;\n(j) any other purpose the disclosure of which is required or authorised by or under written law.\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), the specified person or specified class of persons to whom identifying information may be disclosed may include a police force, a law enforcement body or a border control body of a foreign country.\nAccessing or disclosing identifying information 36C.\u23af(1) If a person accesses identifying information, and the person \u2014\n(a) is not authorised under section 36B to access any identifying information; or\n(b) is not authorised under section 36B to access the identifying information for the purpose for which the person accessed it, the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.\n(2) If the person's conduct causes disclosure of identifying information, and the disclosure is not a disclosure that is for any of the purposes specified in section 36B(2), the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both.\".\n(5) Section 55(1)\n(a) Insert, immediately after paragraph (e), the following paragraphs:\nFirst column\nSecond column \"(ea) providing for the circumstances for granting\nSingapore visas and the conditions subject to which a Singapore visa may be granted;\n(eb) providing for the manner in which personal identifiers (within the meaning of Part VA) are obtained and kept;\".\n(b) Delete paragraphs (gb) and (gc).\n(6) Section 57(1)\nInsert, immediately after the word \"pass\" wherever it appears in paragraphs (i), (j), (k) and (l), the words \", Singapore visa\".\n(7) Section 61A\nRepeal section 61A and substitute the following section:\n\"Amendment of Schedule\n61A. The Minister may, by order published in the Gazette, amend the Schedule, except that any other personal identifier so prescribed in the order must \u2014\n(a) be an image of, or a measurement or recording of, an external part of the human body or a person's voice; and\n(b) not be an identifier the obtaining of which would involve the taking of an intimate sample within the meaning of section 13A of the\nRegistration of\nCriminals Act (Cap. 268).\".\n(8) The Schedule\nRepeal the Schedule and substitute the following\nSchedule:\nSections 2 and 61A\n1. Fingerprints or handprints of a person (including those taken using paper and ink or digital livescanning technologies).\n2. A photograph or other image of a person's face and shoulders.\n3. A person's signature.\".\nThis Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact with amendments the Passports Act (Cap. 220) for the following purposes:\n(a) to combat identity fraud and possible misuse of Singapore passports and other Singapore travel documents, in Singapore and elsewhere, particularly by creating new offences and widening the scope of old offences, and significantly increasing penalties for those offences;\n(b) to introduce measures against the misuse of foreign travel documents in\nSingapore;\n(c) to introduce measures to minimise problems caused by lost or stolen\nSingapore passports and other Singapore travel documents, such as power to refuse to issue a new passport or travel document, issuing limited validity\nSingapore passports or Singapore travel documents, compulsory notification of lost or stolen Singapore passports or Singapore travel documents, penalties for not reporting such lost or stolen passports or travel documents, and additional fees;\n(d) to set out a modernised regime for the issue and administration of Singapore passports and Singapore travel documents; and\n(e) to set out a framework for the adoption of particular methods or technologies, like biometric technologies, for purposes such as identification.\nThe Bill also makes consequential and related amendments to the Immigration Act (Cap. 133).\nPart I contains the preliminary provisions of the Bill.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 defines a range of standard terms used throughout the Bill.\nAn \"authorised officer\" refers to public officers with direct responsibilities for the issuing of Singapore passports and Singapore travel documents, being the Controller of\nImmigration (the Controller), immigration officers duly authorised as such and public officers in the diplomatic staff of Singapore diplomatic missions and consular officers at Singapore consulates. The Minister may, in future and appropriate circumstances, allow other public officers to be authorised officers under the Bill; for example, civil defence officers during natural disasters.\nA \"document\" has been defined to include any article or material from which information is capable of being reproduced with or without the aid of any other article or device. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (known as ICAO) has developed standards for international travel documents that include documents with machine readable zones and integrated circuit chips.\nA \"false Singapore passport\" or a \"false Singapore travel document\" will include a genuine Singapore passport or Singapore travel document that has been altered without authorisation. A \"false foreign travel document\" has been similarly defined.\nA \"foreign travel document\" is defined to mean a foreign passport or a document issued for travel purposes by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country (whether or not also issued for another purpose). The Minister can expand the definition to apply to travel documents issued by international organisations by approving the extension to such organisations.\nA \"Singapore passport\", as defined, can be a Singapore ordinary passport, a\nSingapore diplomatic passport or a Singapore official passport.\nFinally, clause 2(4) defines who has parental responsibility for a child under the Bill, as these persons will have certain responsibilities in connection with applications for a\nSingapore passport or a Singapore travel document under clause 27, and the custody of such documents under clauses 45 and 46. These would be a child's parent, a person who under any order of court, the child is to live with (which can include a person to whose care a child has been committed under the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap. 38)) or the person entitled to guardianship or custody of the child under any written law.\nClause 3 defines the expression \"personal identifier\" to mean any of the following, specified in the First Schedule, including any of the following in digital form:\nfingerprints and handprints of a person (including those taken using paper and ink or digital livescanning technologies); a photograph or other image of a person's face and shoulders; and a person's signature. By clause 3(2), the Minister is empowered to amend the Schedule and prescribe by subsidiary legislation other identifiers, being an image, measurement or recording of, an external part of the human body or human voice. Allowing new types of personal identifiers to be prescribed by subsidiary legislation will permit the adoption of new technologies in a rapidly developing environment for example, video or audio recordings or an iris scan may be included in future. However, clause 3(2) specifically prohibits a type of personal identifier the obtaining of which would involve the taking of an intimate sample within the meaning of section 13A of the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap. 268). For example, the taking of a sample of blood cannot be prescribed as a personal identifier in the subsidiary legislation.\nClause 4 provides that the provisions of the Bill have extra-territorial application.\nThe clause extends the Bill, unless the contrary intention appears, to acts, omissions, matters and things outside Singapore and to all persons, irrespective of their nationality or citizenship.\nClause 5 provides that the Controller is to be responsible for the administration of the Bill, subject to any general or special directions of the Minister. The Controller may delegate the exercise of all or any of his powers or duties under the Bill (except the power of delegation) to any authorised officer, who must then exercise those delegated powers subject to the Controller's directions.\nPart II deals with the issue of Singapore passports and Singapore travel documents.\nClause 6 requires an application for a Singapore passport to be made to the\nController and establishes the formalities for such an application; it must be in the approved form and be accompanied by the prescribed fee and prescribed particulars.\nThe applicant may be required to provide personal identifiers together with his application.\nClause 7 requires the Controller to be satisfied of an applicant's identity and citizenship before issuing a Singapore passport. In the case of a Singapore diplomatic passport or a Singapore official passport, the Controller has to be satisfied that the applicant is a citizen travelling for diplomatic or official purposes or is a dependent of such a person. A Singapore passport may be issued subject to conditions, including furnishing a monetary deposit or such other security (by bond or otherwise) for the performance or due observance by the applicant of any conditions imposed.\nClause 8 deals with the lifespan of a Singapore ordinary passport. A Singapore ordinary passport issued on or after the Bill is in force will be ordinarily valid for\n6 years from the date of its issue. Shorter validity periods may be imposed if this is necessary in the interests of proper administration of the Bill. Singapore ordinary passports which are issued before the Bill is in force will continue with the original lifespan of 11 years (where issued before 1st April 2005) and 6 years (where issued on or after 1st April 2005), respectively. The 6-year lifespan will allow the Government to incorporate new technologies into the Singapore passport and deter criminal elements from forging or abusing these passports. As future technologies may be more durable, the Minister has power, by notification published in the Gazette, to subsequently vary the validity period in the Bill for all Singapore ordinary passports issued on or after such date as is specified in the notification.\nClause 9 provides for the extension of non-biometric Singapore passports, which will be those issued before 15th August 2006. No extensions will, however, be allowed if the extension will result in the validity period exceeding 11 years (for passports issued before 1st April 2005) or 6 years (for passports issued on or after 1st April 2005 but before 15th August 2006) in total. All biometric Singapore passports can never be extended. This is because the chip containing the holder's personal identifiers and other particulars and the validity period of the passport is, following international guidelines, a write-once only device. The information stored in the chip cannot be changed once the biometric Singapore passport has been issued.\nClause 10 allows the Controller to endorse on a Singapore passport such alterations or additions as may be necessary to render accurate the particulars recorded therein, as well as to delete any such endorsements made.\nClause 11 describes the purpose of a Singapore temporary travel document, which is a new category of travel document that may be issued to citizens. All Singapore temporary travel documents will be biometric documents with a machine-readable\ncomponent. A Singapore temporary travel document may be issued in lieu of or in addition to a Singapore passport. The Controller may issue a Singapore temporary travel document to a citizen where for reasons of passport security and integrity, the\nController considers that it is not desirable to issue that citizen with a Singapore passport. It is also possible for a citizen to be a holder of a Singapore passport and a\nSingapore temporary travel document concurrently. The Controller may also issue a\nSingapore temporary travel document to a citizen who is already the holder of a\nSingapore passport if he is satisfied that there are other exceptional circumstances.\nClause 12 requires an application for a Singapore temporary travel document to be made to the Controller and establishes the formalities for such an application; it must be in the approved form and be accompanied by the prescribed fee and prescribed particulars. The applicant may be required to provide personal identifiers together with his application.\nClause 13 requires the Controller to be satisfied of an applicant's identity and citizenship before issuing a Singapore temporary travel document. Like a Singapore passport, a Singapore temporary travel document may be issued subject to conditions, including furnishing a monetary deposit or such other security (by bond or otherwise) as the Controller may think sufficient to secure the performance or due observance by the applicant of any conditions imposed.\nClause 14 deals with the lifespan of a Singapore temporary travel document. A\nSingapore temporary travel document will be ordinarily valid for a year. Shorter validity periods may be imposed if this is necessary in the interests of proper administration of the Bill. As future technologies may be more durable, the Minister has power, by notification published in the Gazette, to subsequently vary the validity period in the Bill for all Singapore temporary travel documents issued on or after such date as is specified in the notification.\nClause 15 provides that a Singapore temporary travel document cannot be extended, because the chip containing the holder's personal identifiers and other particulars and the validity period of the Singapore temporary travel document is a write-once only device. The information stored in the chip cannot be changed once the Singapore temporary travel document has been issued.\nClause 16 allows the Controller to issue a Singapore document of identity or other emergency travel document to a person whom he reasonably believes to be a citizen of\nSingapore. The Singapore document of identity or other emergency travel document may be issued where the person wishes to travel immediately, but, for reasons of passport security and integrity, the Controller considers that it is not desirable to issue that person with a Singapore passport. This would be situations where the person's\nSingapore passport may either have been stolen or lost or destroyed, or an emergency has affected the availability of the information necessary to ascertain whether or not that person is already the holder of a Singapore passport.\nClause 17 provides that a Singapore document of identity or other emergency travel document will be valid only for such a time as, in the opinion of the Controller, will be sufficient to enable the person to leave and return to Singapore, to return to Singapore, or to complete his or her specified journey, as the case may require.\nClause 18 will allow the Controller to issue a range of other documents for the purposes of travel. The nature of these documents and the circumstances in which they may be issued will be prescribed by the Minister in the regulations. As the circumstances in which these documents are issued will vary significantly and new types of documents may be created over time, it is appropriate to specify these documents in subsidiary legislation. An example of these other documents issued for the purposes of travel is the certificate of identity. A certificate of identity may be issued to a person who is stateless, or is unable for any reason to obtain a travel document from the government or other appropriate authority in the country of his or her nationality. There is no entitlement to a certificate of identity.\nPart III seeks to remove the existing ambiguity in relation to refusals and cancellations of Singapore passports and Singapore travel documents by setting out the grounds for the Controller to do so, and the necessary mechanisms to refuse or cancel\nSingapore passports and Singapore travel documents for reasons connected with law enforcement. The grounds for refusal of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document have been elaborated on to include the instance where there are grounds to believe the person is likely to engage in conduct that would constitute a specified seizable offence.\nClause 19 describes the situations where the Controller may refuse a Singapore passport, such as when the applicant is already a Singapore passport holder, or the applicant falls within the specific circumstances in clause 23 or 24. The Controller may refuse a Singapore passport to an applicant who, in the 10 years preceding the application, has been convicted of an offence under the Bill or the repealed Act, or of a seizable offence prescribed in the regulations. The Controller retains a general discretion to cancel a Singapore passport independent of the power to refuse based on specified conduct in Part III.\nClause 20 describes the situations where the Controller may refuse a Singapore travel document, many of which are similar to those in clause 19. The Controller may, however, refuse a Singapore travel document to an applicant who, in the 3 years preceding the application, has been convicted of an offence under the Bill or the repealed Act, or of a seizable offence prescribed in the regulations. As in clause 19, the\nController retains a general discretion to cancel a Singapore travel document independent of the power to refuse based on specified conduct in Part III.\nClause 21 describes the situations in which the Controller may cancel a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document.\nClause 21(2)(a) to (c) sets out the administrative reasons, covering documents that have been reported lost or stolen, the issue of a new Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document, and where the particulars recorded in the Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document are incorrect. Clause 21(2)(d) to (f) parallels the specific reasons for refusing a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document described in\nclauses 23 and 24. Clause 21(2)(g) allows the Controller to cancel a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document if the Controller becomes aware of circumstances that would have required or permitted the Controller to refuse to issue the Singapore passport or Singapore travel document had he been aware of the circumstances immediately before issuing the Singapore passport or Singapore travel document. This will be used when information is obtained, for example, that a false statement had been provided with an application such that the Controller would not have been satisfied as to identity or citizenship. Clause 21(2)(h) allows the Controller to cancel a Singapore passport or a Singapore temporary travel document when the holder of which ceases to be a citizen of Singapore. However, no notice needs to be given by the Controller before cancelling a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document the holder of which has died, or a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document which has expired. The Controller retains a general discretion to cancel a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document independent of the power to cancel based on specified conduct above.\nClause 22 describes the peculiar situations applicable to Singapore documents of identity or other emergency travel documents and in which the Controller may recall and cancel them.\nThe reasons for refusal of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document for law enforcement reasons are set out in Division 2 (clauses 23 and 24). The Division recognises that the Controller has the primary responsibility for the issue of Singapore passports and Singapore travel documents, whereas law enforcement agencies and others have the primary legal responsibility in relation to preventing a person from travelling internationally.\nClause 23 empowers the Controller to refuse to issue a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document, or to cancel a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document if he believes, on reasonable grounds, that the applicant for or holder of the\nSingapore passport or Singapore travel document is the subject of a warrant of arrest issued in Singapore for a prescribed seizable offence, or is prevented from leaving\nSingapore by force of a Singapore law enforcement order or direction.\n\"Prevented from travelling internationally\" has been defined in clause 23(2) to include 4 situations; when the order or other direction indicates that the person is required to remain in Singapore, the person is required to surrender his Singapore passport or Singapore travel document, the person is not permitted to apply for a\nSingapore passport or a Singapore travel document, or the person is not permitted to obtain a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document. A supervision order under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) would be an example of such a direction preventing a person from travelling internationally.\nClause 24 allows the Controller to refuse to issue a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document to a person if the Controller receives a request from a competent authority which believes, on reasonable grounds, that the person is likely to engage in harmful conduct. The types of harmful conduct are (i) conduct that might prejudice the security of Singapore or a foreign country, (ii) conduct that might endanger the health or physical safety of other persons (whether in Singapore or a foreign country), (iii) conduct which might constitute an offence against the Bill or (iv)\nconduct which might constitute a seizable offence against any written law which is prescribed in the regulations. The offences to be prescribed may include offences which have an extended geographical jurisdiction, such as terrorism.\nThe term \"likely to engage\" is used in clause 24 to ensure that a competent authority can only make a request to the Controller where there is a real, and not remote, possibility of a person engaging in the specified conduct. A competent authority may not know whether a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document has been issued to the person at the time of making the request. To limit the persons who can make a request under clause 24, clause 24(6) defines a \"competent authority\" as a public authority or public officer prescribed by the regulations to be a competent authority in relation to the circumstance. The persons to be prescribed would be the police and local security and public health agencies.\nThe reasons for refusal of Singapore passports or Singapore travel documents for administrative and other reasons are set out in Division 3 (clauses 25, 26 and 27).\nClause 25 will allow the Controller to refuse to issue a Singapore passport to a person where 2 or more passports issued to the person have been lost or stolen and for reasons of passport security and integrity, the Controller considers that it is not desirable to issue that person with another Singapore passport. This will enable the\nController to act where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is allowing others to use the Singapore passport for identity fraud or other criminal activity, or that the person is simply not adequately protecting his or her Singapore passport.\nClause 26 will prohibit the Controller from issuing a new Singapore passport to a person who has already been issued with a valid Singapore passport or a valid\nSingapore travel document. This is to prevent potential abuse by the holder of multiple\nSingapore passports. However, the Controller may do so in exceptions which are prescribed or specified in the Minister's directions issued under clause 5(2). Examples include holders of Singapore diplomatic or official passports.\nClause 27 provides that the Controller must not issue a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document to a child unless a person with parental responsibility for a child consents to the child travelling internationally or an order of a court permits the child to travel internationally.\nClause 28 provides for an appeal to the Minister against any decision of the\nController relating to the issuing (including reduced validity) and cancellation of a\nSingapore passport or a Singapore travel document. The Minister may designate a\nMinister of State to hear such appeals in his place. An appeal must be made within\n14 days of being notified of the Controller's decision, and the Minister's decision is final. There is power for the Minister to extend the time for appeal in exceptional circumstances.\nHowever, any decision to refuse to issue a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document cannot be appealed against if it is based on the existence of a warrant of arrest. This matter is more appropriately dealt with through the court which made the order.\nPart IV outlines the powers of the Controller and authorised officers in the discharge of functions under the Bill. It also includes offences relating to failure to obey lawful demands of the Controller or such officers. The offences in this Part will carry the penalty of a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding\n6 months or both.\nClause 29 empowers an authorised officer or a police officer to demand the surrender of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document that the officer suspects on reasonable grounds has been obtained by means of a false or misleading statement, information or document. An authorised officer or a police officer is also conferred the power to demand a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document or other document which the officer reasonably suspects has been used in the commission of an offence against the Bill. It will be an offence for a person to fail to immediately surrender the person's Singapore passport or Singapore travel documents in the person's possession or control to an authorised officer or police officer if demanded to do so.\nClause 30 empowers an authorised officer to demand the surrender of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document that has been cancelled or is invalid. It will also be an offence for a person to fail to immediately surrender the person's Singapore passport or Singapore travel documents in the person's possession or control to an authorised officer if demanded to do so.\nClause 31 empowers any authorised officer, police officer or customs officer to seize a document that is not in the possession or control of any person where the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the document has been used in the commission (or attempted commission) of an offence against the Bill. Such an officer may also search a container (including baggage) not in the possession or control of any person where the officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the container contains a document used in the commission of an offence against the Bill. This is to address the circumstances where suspicious travel documents are being sent through airports or in the mail. An authorised officer, a police officer or a customs officer is also conferred powers to forcibly enter without warrant any premises, or stop, board and search any train, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, in or on which he reasonably suspects that there is to be found a false Singapore passport, a false Singapore travel document, a false foreign travel document or other document that has been used in the commission of an offence against the Bill.\nClause 32 empowers the Controller, any authorised officer who is an immigration officer or any police officer to arrest without warrant any person committing or attempting to commit, or whom he reasonably suspects of being engaged in committing or attempting to commit, any offence under the Bill. An immigration officer who is an authorised officer will have all the powers of a police officer under the Criminal\nProcedure Code (Cap. 68) in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence.\nClause 33 provides that a person will only be guilty of an offence, such as failing to comply with the lawful demands of an immigration officer, a police officer or a customs officer under this Part, if the documents are in the person's possession or control, and the immigration officer, police officer or customs officer declares his office if he is not in uniform and identifies himself.\nPart V contains offences. It seeks to combat identity fraud and possible misuse of\nSingapore passports and other Singapore travel documents in Singapore and elsewhere, by creating new offences and widening the scope of old offences, and significantly increasing penalties for those offences. It also creates offences for the misuse of foreign travel documents in Singapore. Penalties have been significantly increased from a maximum fine of $1,000 and/or a maximum of 6 months' imprisonment to a maximum fine for most offences of $10,000 and/or a maximum for most offences of\n10 years' imprisonment or both.\nClause 34 provides that these offences will apply with extended geographical jurisdiction. That is, a person may be liable for prosecution for an offence against the\nBill regardless of whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs within Singapore and whether or not a result of the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Singapore.\nClause 35 defines various expressions used in this Part, such as \"gain\", \"loss\" and \"public duty\".\nClause 36 makes it an offence for a person to make a false Singapore passport or a false Singapore travel document, or make a copy of such a passport or travel document, with the dishonest intention that it is to be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to dishonestly obtain a gain (whether for himself or someone else), to cause a loss to the other person or someone else, or influences the exercise of a public duty. It also makes it an offence to make or have in one's possession or control a device, machine, paper, material or other thing, with the knowledge that it is or has been specially designed or adapted for the making of a document and with the intention that it would be used in the making of a false\nSingapore passport or a false Singapore travel document. The clause also provides for a defence of reasonable excuse to the offence of being in possession of such devices, machines, papers, materials or other things.\nClause 37 makes it an offence for a person to have possession or control of a false\nSingapore passport or a false Singapore travel document, where the person knows or ought reasonably to have known that the document was false. There is a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 38 is a new offence of bringing, taking or sending across international borders a false Singapore passport or a false Singapore travel document or a Singapore passport or Singapore travel document issued to someone else. The clause will cover\nsituations where a person is involved in trafficking of documents, but where it is difficult to prove that the person has had possession of the documents. The person will be guilty if he knows or ought reasonably to have known that the document is a false\nSingapore passport or a false Singapore travel document, or the Singapore passport or\nSingapore travel document is not his. There is a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 39 provides that in a statement or given information (which includes any personal identifier like a photograph) that relates to an application for a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document, an application for an extension or endorsement thereof or a report of any loss, theft or destruction of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document, it will be an offence to omit any matter or thing which makes the statement or given information false or misleading in a material particular.\nThe clause provides a defence where the statement or information is not false or misleading in a material particular. Recklessness will apply to the circumstance that the statement is misleading or omits any matter or thing without which the statement is misleading.\nClause 40 is in similar terms to clause 39, but will cover furnishing of false or misleading documents in connection with an application for a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document. This includes supplying false or misleading documents with an application for a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document submitted through deposit boxes or other forms of remote applications.\nClause 41 sets out the offences of using a cancelled Singapore passport or Singapore travel document, of using, having possession or control of a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document that was not issued to the person, and allowing another person to use a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document that was issued to the person. The clause also provides for a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 42 sets out the offence of selling a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document. In addition to making unlawful an outright sale of a Singapore passport or a\nSingapore travel document, transactions like barter and exchange, offering or attempting to sell, exposing for sale, or receiving or sending or delivering for sale, of a\nSingapore passport or a Singapore travel document are also unlawful. The penalty is a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment or both.\nClause 42(2) also makes it an offence to engage in the business or trade of selling\nSingapore passports or Singapore travel documents. This offence carries a mandatory jail term of not less than 2 years and up to 15 years and a mandatory fine of up to\n$20,000.\nClause 43 deals with the situation where a person intentionally damages or destroys a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document. This can include damaging or deleting data from a storage device contained in a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document.\nClause 44 creates a new offence of obtaining a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document through dishonesty or threat. This offence will cover situations in which it may not be possible to establish a person's possession of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document.\nClause 45 states the offence of failing to report a lost, stolen or destroyed Singapore passport or Singapore travel document. It will require that the person knows that the\nSingapore passport or Singapore travel document is lost, stolen or destroyed before an offence can be made out. The clause also provides for a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 46 makes it an offence for the holder of a Singapore passport or a Singapore temporary travel document to fail to surrender the cancelled or invalid Singapore passport or Singapore temporary travel document within 24 hours of such cancellation or ceasing to be valid. Where the holder is below 16 years of age, any parent of his or his legal guardian, has to surrender the cancelled or invalid Singapore passport or\nSingapore temporary travel document. The clause requires that the holder, parent or guardian, as the case may be, knows that the Singapore passport or Singapore temporary travel document is cancelled or invalid before an offence can be made out.\nThe clause further provides for a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 47 is in similar terms to clauses 36, 37 and 41, but will cover foreign travel documents and the misuse of these in Singapore. The clause also provides for a defence of reasonable excuse.\nClause 48 applies to the Controller and authorised officers who issue a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document contrary to the requirements set out in the Bill.\nClause 49 makes it an offence to hinder, delay or obstruct any authorised officer, police officer or customs officer in the performance and execution of his duty or of anything which he is empowered or required to do by virtue or in consequence of or under the Bill.\nClause 50 deals with offenders which are corporations or unincorporated associations.\nClause 51 provides that a District Court will have jurisdiction to try any offence under the Bill and will have power to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of the offence.\nClause 52 empowers the Controller to compound certain offences by collecting from a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum not exceeding\n$500.\nPart VI sets out a framework to allow the Government to take advantage of technologies (such as facial biometrics) for passport controls. In May 2003, the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation (known as ICAO) adopted a global, harmonised blueprint for the integration of biometric identification into passports and other Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTDs). ICAO's blueprint relies on facial recognition as the \"globally interoperable biometric for machine-assisted identity confirmation with MRTDs\". The proposed measures will align Singapore with similar travel measures in place in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Union. While the collection of identifying information (which\nincludes personal identifiers) from citizens under this Part will allow authorised officers to better identify, or confirm the claimed identity, of an applicant or holder of a\nSingapore passport or a Singapore travel document, there are also provisions in this Part which will protect the privacy of such persons by placing limits on the access and disclosure of such identifying information.\nClause 53 inserts definitions of \"disclose\" and \"identifying information\" for the purposes of Part VI. \"Identifying information\" is defined broadly to include any personal identifier, any meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier, any record of a result of analysing any personal identifier or meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier, or any other information, derived from any personal identifier, any meaningful identifier derived from any personal identifier or any record of a kind referred to above that could be used to discover a particular person's identity or to get information about a particular person.\nClause 54 provides that the Minister may approve particular methods and technologies (including the adoption of biometric technologies) that are to be used to confirm the validity of evidence of the identity of an applicant for a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document or the holder of such a document, or for performing other functions connected with the Bill. This can include the introduction of facial biometric technology (being measurements of a person's face that can allow a computer to verify the identity of a person) or fingerprinting or the use of genetic information (such as DNA testing and comparison) as an effective means of verifying identity.\nMethods or technologies not approved may still be used for performing such functions.\nClause 55 sets out who may be authorised to access or disclose identifying information, and for what purposes. The Minister may, in writing, authorise a specified person, or any person included in a specified class of persons, to access or disclose identifying information of the kind specified in the Minister's authorisation. The\nMinister must specify, in the authorisation, the purpose or purposes for which access to or disclosure of identifying information is authorised. The purposes must be one or more of the following:\n(a) assisting in the identification of, and authenticating the identity of, any applicant for or holder of a Singapore passport or a Singapore travel document;\n(b) facilitating or otherwise assisting the international travel of a person to whom a Singapore travel document has been issued;\n(c) enforcement of the criminal law, including investigating or prosecuting a person for an offence against any written law;\n(d) combating document and identity fraud in immigration matters;\n(e) administering or managing the storage of identifying information;\n(f) modifying identifying information to enable it to be matched with other identifying information, or in order to correct errors or ensure compliance with appropriate standards;\n(g) identifying persons who are of national security concern, or who are associated with activities of a criminal nature and whose detention or supervision may be necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order;\n(h) any other purpose the disclosure of which is required or authorised by or under written law;\n(i) making decisions under the Bill or the Immigration Act (Cap. 133) or the regulations made under either law.\nThe specified persons may comprise public officers, employees of public authorities and persons contracted by the Government or public authority to perform certain public functions.\nClause 56 makes it an offence for a person to access identifying information where that person is not authorised under clause 55 to access the identifying information for the purpose for which the person accessed it. The clause also makes it an offence for a person to engage in conduct that causes disclosure of identifying information if the disclosure is not a disclosure that is for any of the purposes specified in clause 55(2).\nThe penalty for these offences is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both.\nPart VII contains general provisions.\nClause 57 states that every Singapore passport and every Singapore travel document, whether issued before, on or after the commencement of the Bill, will be the property of the Government. This reflects established international practice. The provision is important to buttress the Singapore Government's claim for the return of a travel document from a foreign government which has taken custody of the document.\nClause 58 enables the Minister to exempt any person or class or description of persons from the operation of any or all of the provisions of the Bill. The exemption will be by way of an order published in the Gazette.\nClause 59 relates to the service and sending of any document required or authorised to be served under the Bill, but not documents to be served in court proceedings. In addition to the usual modes of service, such as personal delivery, post and facsimile transmission, service of documents by electronic communication by email is also allowed. For documents sent by electronic communication to an email address, these will be deemed to have been duly served on the person to whom it is addressed at the time of entering the information system addressed to the email address.\nClause 60 empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of the Bill.\nThere is specific power for the Minister to prescribe fees in respect of applications for\nSingapore passports or Singapore travel documents, and for endorsements thereon. The relationship between the fees charged and the actual cost may vary so as to respond to the reasonable demands of Singapore travellers. For example, different fees may be set\nfor those who repeatedly lose Singapore passports. Variations in fees may come about with the introduction of new technologies. This is to address the constitutional uncertainty whether such fees are a tax if these are not cost recovery.\nClause 61 repeals the Passports Act (Cap. 220).\nClause 62 (read with the Second Schedule) makes consequential and related amendments to the Immigration Act (Cap. 133).\nClause 63 provides various savings and transitional provisions consequential on the repeal of the Passports Act, and allows the Minister, within 2 years, to prescribe by regulations such other transitional and savings provisions as he may consider necessary or expedient.\nThe First Schedule sets out various personal identifiers. By clause 3(2), the Minister is empowered to amend the First Schedule and prescribe by subsidiary legislation other identifiers, an image, measurement or recording of an external part of the human body.\nThe Second Schedule sets out the related and consequential amendments to the\nImmigration Act. The amendments in the Second Schedule \u2014\n(a) provide for the grant of Singapore visas to non-citizens as a consequence of the repeal and re-enactment of the Passports Act; and\n(b) set out a framework for the adoption of similar methods or technologies, like biometric technologies, as under the Passports Bill 2007 for purposes such as identification of persons entering and leaving Singapore accompanied by suitable privacy-related measures and limits on the purposes to which identifying information collected from non-citizens under the Bill may be applied.\nThe present definition of \"personal identifier\" in the Immigration Act is amended to be consistent with the definition in the Passports Bill 2007. A new definition of \"Singapore visa\" is introduced. It is defined as one granted under the new Part IIA.\nA new section 5A also requires every person, whether a citizen of Singapore or a non-citizen, who arrives in Singapore from outside the country, or is leaving Singapore for a country outside, to produce his or her valid passport or travel document to an immigration officer. There is provision for waiver of and exemption from this requirement.\nThe new Part IIA covers the grant of Singapore visas for non-citizens. The issue of\nSingapore visas is dealt with by the Passports Act which the Passports Bill 2007 seeks to repeal. The new Part IIA of the Immigration Act provides for the grant of Singapore visas to non-citizens to travel to and enter Singapore. However, a Singapore visa that is in effect is not a pass or other permission for, and does not confer any right on, the holder to enter Singapore.\nA new Part VA, which is similar to Part VI of the Passports Bill 2007, is also inserted into the Immigration Act. While technological advances will be used to ensure the accurate identification of non-citizens seeking to enter Singapore and to facilitate quick and unobtrusive immigration entry processes, Part VA sets out obligations on the\nController of Immigration concerning identifying information collected by or under the\nImmigration Act (Cap. 133) and the permitted uses of such information. The provisions in Part VA place clearer limits on the access and disclosure of such identifying information, than what is presently prescribed in the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Rg 1).\nSection 55(1) is also amended to confer on the Minister additional powers in making regulations in connection with new Parts IIA and VA. The Minister may make regulations providing for the circumstances for granting Singapore visas and the conditions subject to which a Singapore visa may be granted, and providing for the manner in which personal identifiers (within the meaning of Part VA) are obtained and kept.\nCertain offences in section 57(1) are amended to extend their scope to include\nSingapore visas.\nSection 61A, which relates to the power of the Minister to vary the Schedule specifying the personal identifiers, is also replaced by a new section 61A, under which the Minister is empowered to amend the Schedule and prescribe by subsidiary legislation other identifiers, being an image, measurement or recording of an external part of the human body. Allowing new types of personal identifiers to be prescribed by subsidiary legislation will permit the adoption of new technologies in a rapidly developing environment; for example, video or audio recordings or an iris scan may be included in future. Like the Passports Bill 2007, the new section 61A specifically prohibits a type of personal identifier the obtaining of which would involve the taking of an intimate sample within the meaning of section 13A of the Registration of\nCriminals Act (Cap. 268).\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

No. S 507/2009);\n(b) to require records obtained from such measures to be kept for a specified time, and to require the records on the operations of a casino to be kept in a manner sufficient to permit a reconstruction of each transaction so that they can serve as evidence in a prosecution for an offence; and\n(c) to enable regulations to be made to detect or prevent both money laundering and terrorism financing.\nClause 4 amends item 9 of the First Schedule to the Criminal Law (Temporary\nProvisions) Act (Cap. 67) due to the renaming of the Ministry of Information,\nCommunications and the Arts as the Ministry of Communications and\nInformation.\nClause 5 amends the section heading of section 227 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode (Cap. 68) to reflect more accurately its subject\u2010matter, as the section does not deal with retraction of a plea.\nClause 6 amends section 6 of the Home Affairs Uniformed Services\nSuperannuation Act (Cap. 126B) to replace the Public Service Commission with a Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs or his delegate, as the authority who has the power to reduce or withhold any benefit which a civil defence officer, intelligence officer, narcotics officer, prison officer or senior police officer who is a member of the INVEST Plan may be awarded under that Plan.\nClause 7 amends the Patents Act (Cap. 221) \u2014\n(a) to amend the definition of \"related national phase application\" so that an international application for a patent (Singapore) that has entered the national phase in a foreign jurisdiction may be a related national phase application, not just of an international application for a patent (Singapore) that has entered the national phase in Singapore, but also\nof an application which derived its filing date from an international application for a patent (Singapore) that has entered the national phase in\nSingapore;\n(b) to enable the Registrar of Patents to delegate any of his powers or functions under the Act to any person with the relevant qualifications or experience, and to deem such person as a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) when exercising the power or function;\n(c) to provide, under section 29B (which deals with the review of an examination report, a search and examination report or a supplementary examination report), that an applicant given a notice of eligibility to proceed to the grant of a patent by the Registrar of Patents must comply with the formal requirements and file prescribed documents for the grant within the prescribed time;\n(d) to provide an option to file with the Registrar of Patents a notice of an express trust to be entered in the register of patents, though the Registrar will not be affected by such notice when carrying out his duties;\n(e) to enable the Minister to amend the Schedule (which sets out substances which are not pharmaceutical products for the purposes of the Act) to the\nAct by an order; and\n(f) to amend certain definitions in the Schedule for consistency with the\nMedicines (Traditional Medicines, Homoeopathic Medicines and other\nSubstances) (Exemption) Order (O 6).\nRegarding the amendment in paragraph (d) above and similar amendments under clauses 8 and 13, it should be noted that the general law as to when a person is affected by notice of a trust on a register is unaffected by the amendments.\nClause 8 amends the Registered Designs Act (Cap. 266) \u2014\n(a) to enable the Registrar of Designs to delegate any of his powers or functions under the Act to any person with the relevant qualifications or experience, and to deem such person as a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) when exercising the power or function; and\n(b) to provide an option to file with the Registrar of Designs a notice of an express trust to be entered in the Register of Designs, though the Registrar will not be affected by such notice when carrying out his duties.\nClause 9 repeals section 82 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276). Section 82 provides that a person cannot be convicted of an offence under section 64 (reckless or dangerous driving) or 65 (driving without due care or reasonable consideration) or an offence of speeding, unless he has been issued with a warning, or served a summons or notice of intended prosecution within a prescribed time.

An inspection under section 17 does not extend to the transport of prescribed scheduled chemicals specified in the Act.\nClause 12 inserts a new section 23A where a national inspector has reason to suspect that any vehicle has been used, or is being used, in contravention of the new section 9A. In such a case, the national inspector may \u2014\n(a) stop and board the vehicle and exercise any inspection power for a compliance purpose;\n(b) seize any matter or thing from the vehicle that the national inspector reasonably believes to be the subject matter of, or to be connected with the commission of, an offence under the new section 9A; and\n(c) arrest any individual whom the national inspector has reason to believe has committed any offence under the new section 9A, if the individual's name and address are unknown to the national inspector and \u2014\n(i) the individual refuses to give the individual's name and address when required by the national inspector; or\n(ii) there is reason to doubt the accuracy of the name or address, if given.\nClause 12 further requires a national inspector who seizes any matter or thing under the new section 23A(1)(b) to give to the owner of the matter or thing a written inventory of all matters or things so seized.

The clause also amends section 33(2) to empower the Minister to prescribe the fees for an application under, or for any other purpose of, the Act. This amendment consolidates the Minister's power to prescribe fees in respect of the Act in a single provision.\nClause 13 also amends section 33(2) to empower regulations to impose a maximum term of 2 years' imprisonment on conviction of any prescribed offences in respect of the contravention of or non-compliance with any regulations made under that section.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The BMSMA is amended by inserting, immediately after section 85, the following section:\n\"Limited right to representation by management corporation in non\u2010lot acquisition\n85A.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding anything in section 85, the management corporation for a strata title plan \u2014\n(a) may start any proceedings before the Appeals Board under the\nLand Acquisition Act for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan and represent every subsidiary proprietor of every\nlot comprised in the strata title plan in those proceedings; and\n(b) may lodge any appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the Appeals Board under the Land Acquisition Act for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan and represent every subsidiary proprietor of every lot comprised in the strata title plan\nin that appeal, if, and only if, the proceedings and appeal, respectively, are each authorised by an ordinary resolution of the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation.\n(2) Unless authorised by ordinary resolution, a management\ncorporation for a strata title plan shall not make a claim for compensation under the Land Acquisition Act for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to its strata title plan.\n(3) Unless otherwise agreed by special resolution under subsection (4), the amount of compensation awarded under the Land Acquisition Act for\nany non\u2010lot acquisition relating to a strata title plan shall be paid into the management fund of the management corporation for that strata title plan.\nTHE SCHEDULE \u2014 continued\n(4) The subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation for a strata title plan may, by special resolution, agree that the compensation for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title\nplan be distributed among themselves; in which event that compensation must be distributed among the subsidiary proprietors in shares proportionate to their respective share values of their lots as on the date possession is taken under section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act of the land acquired under the non\u2010lot acquisition.\n(5) Unless authorised by a resolution by consensus, a management corporation for a strata title plan shall not express any desire under section 49(1) of the Land Acquisition Act for the whole of the land comprised in its strata title plan to be acquired under that Act.\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 152) \u2014\n(a) to provide for a special procedure for claims to compensation where only the common property of a strata development is compulsorily acquired (defined as a \"non\u2010lot acquisition\");\n(b) to provide that where the value of any remaining land of a claimant for compensation is increased because of the use to which the land acquired will be put, that increase may be set-off only against the amount of compensation that would otherwise be payable for severing the claimant's land or for injurious affection, or both; and\n(c) to introduce amendments of a housekeeping nature so as to streamline certain processes connected with land acquisition.\nRelated to the amendments on non\u2010lot acquisitions, the Bill contains related amendments to the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) to define a management corporation's right to representation in connection with such claims to compensation and to allow the use of the sinking fund to meet non\u2010lot acquisition related expenses.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2(1) to introduce the new definition of \"non\u2010lot acquisition\", which is relevant only in the case of strata developments.\nThe shortened expression \"non\u2010lot acquisition\" means any compulsory acquisition under the Act where no specific lot belonging to a subsidiary\nproprietor is being taken under the Act. These are cases where only common property comprised in a strata title plan is compulsorily acquired.\nThe other new expressions \"common property\", \"lot\", \"strata title plan\" and \"subsidiary proprietor\" are assigned the same meanings as in the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158).\nClause 2 also amends the definition of \"land\" in section 2(1) to make it clear that it includes foreshores.\nClause 2 also amends section 2(2) to deem the management corporation constituted for a strata title plan to be the person entitled to act for, and the person authorised to receive service within Singapore on behalf of, every subsidiary proprietor of every lot comprised in the strata title plan with respect to any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan. This will allow a Collector of Land\nRevenue (Collector) to serve notices and deal with the management corporation instead of every subsidiary proprietor, where no specific lot belonging to a subsidiary proprietor is being taken under the Act. This also facilitates representation of subsidiary proprietors by a management corporation in such cases of compulsory acquisition.\nFinally, clause 2 introduces a new subsection (3) to section 2 so as to ensure that a management corporation constituted for a strata title plan is not disqualified under section 2(2)(i) or 40(2) but is competent to receive any compensation awarded for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to its strata title plan. This is because any common property in a strata development is owned not by the management corporation but is owned jointly by the subsidiary proprietors as tenants\u2010in\u2010common, and there are provisions in the Building Maintenance and\nStrata Management Act which require particular resolutions to be first passed before a management corporation can alienate and sell any common property that is comprised in the strata title plan. The new section 2(3) deems the management corporation competent to alienate the common property so acquired.\nClause 3 amends section 8 for 2 purposes. Firstly, section 8(3)(b)(i) is amended to make it clear that a Collector's notice of intended acquisition can require a person entitled to act for a person interested to appear before the Collector at the requisite inquiry following the publication in the Gazette of the compulsory acquisition of the land.\nThe second amendment to section 8 makes it clear that in the case of any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to a strata title plan, only the management corporation for the strata title plan can make a claim for compensation in respect of any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan. The Collector can therefore reject any claim for compensation as a result of the non\u2010lot acquisition if the claim is made by a subsidiary proprietor constituting the management corporation, or a mortgagee, chargee or other person with an estate and interest in any lot comprised in the strata title plan.\nClause 4 amends section 9(1) to expressly empower a Collector to require documentation pertinent to claims to compensation made by management corporations. These documents are the ordinary resolution required under section 85A(2) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act to authorise the management corporation to make that claim and any special resolution referred to in section 85A(4) of that Act on the distribution of the compensation among the subsidiary proprietors. This will supplement the\nCollector's existing power to require a statement containing the name of every person possessing any interest in the land or any part thereof as co-owner, mortgagee, lessee, sub\u2010lessee, tenant or otherwise, and of the nature of that interest,\netc.\nClause 5 amends section 10 (which deals with the awards of compensation by a\nCollector) to state the general rule that any amount of compensation awarded for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to a strata title plan will not be apportioned among the subsidiary proprietors owning lots in that strata title plan but be awarded to the management corporation. The exception is where the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation agree by a special resolution referred to in section 85A(4) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act.\nIf such a special resolution under section 85A(4) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act is passed, the amount of compensation awarded for a non\u2010lot acquisition is to be apportioned among the subsidiary proprietors in shares proportional to the share values of their respective lots. As the compulsory acquisition process can span some time, during which it is not uncommon for ownership in lots comprised in the affected strata title plan to change, the new section 10(1B) fixes the distribution among persons who, on the date possession is taken under section 16 of the acquired land, are the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation.\nClause 6 makes an amendment to section 14 to confer power on a Collector to compel the production of any resolution by the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation for a strata title plan which is relevant to the making of any award of compensation for the acquisition under the Act.\nClause 7 repeals and re-enacts section 16 so that notice of taking possession of acquired land may be served in other ways other than posting notices on the acquired land. The Collector may instead notify directly the persons interested or persons entitled to act by serving on them the appropriate notice of taking possession. The modes of service are currently set out in section 45. For example, where service on a person interested is not practicable because the person's whereabouts are unknown, a Collector can still take possession of the acquired land provided the Collector advertises that fact in one or more daily newspapers as is appropriate and necessary to bring the matter to the attention of the person or management corporation concerned.\nClause 8 amends section 23 firstly, to extend the time for claimants to lodge notices of appeal and petitions of appeal against awards, and to make the requisite deposit for such an appeal, to the Appeals Board. As the related amendments to the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act (see clause 16 and the\nSchedule) will require an ordinary resolution before a management corporation can lodge any appeal to the Appeals Board, the time for making appeals has to be extended to accommodate the minimum notice period statutorily prescribed by that\nAct for the holding of a general meeting of a management corporation.\nThe second amendment to section 23 provides that, in the case of any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to a strata title plan, no subsidiary proprietor constituting the management corporation for the strata title plan, and no mortgagee, chargee or other person with an estate and interest in any lot comprised in the strata title plan, will be entitled to lodge any appeal or petition of appeal to the Appeals Board against the award of compensation by a Collector for the non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan. Only the management corporation constituted for the strata title plan is entitled to lodge any notice of appeal or petition of appeal in respect of the same non\u2010lot acquisition. The management corporation must, before doing so, secure the ordinary resolution required under section 85A(1) of the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act.\nClause 9 amends section 24(b) as a consequence of the amendment in clause 8.\nAn appeal will still be deemed withdrawn if the petition of appeal in connection with a non\u2010lot acquisition is lodged by a person who is disqualified under the amended section 23 from doing so.\nClause 10 amends section 29 to provide that any subsidiary proprietor constituting the management corporation for a strata title plan, and any mortgagee, chargee or other person with an estate and interest in any lot comprised in the strata title plan, will not be entitled to appeal to the Court of\nAppeal with respect to any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan. After this amendment, only the management corporation constituted for that strata title plan will be entitled to make an appeal to the Court of Appeal in respect of the same non\u2010lot acquisition, if the management corporation secures the ordinary resolution required under section 85A(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act to make such an appeal.\nClause 11 amends section 32 (relating to costs on appeal to the Appeals Board) to empower the Appeals Board to order costs against persons who are not parties to the appeal, for example, valuers and solicitors who advise parties to an appeal. In proceedings in an appeal, it may appear to the Appeals Board that something has been done or not done by or on behalf of any party thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracting, or adding to the costs or complexity of, those proceedings, or putting any party to any unnecessary expense in relation to those proceedings. In this case, the amendment to section 32 empowers the\nAppeals Board to order the person who is not a party whom it considers to be\nresponsible (whether personally or through an employee or agent) to repay to his client costs which the client has been ordered to pay to any other party to the proceedings or to personally pay the whole or part of the costs of the proceedings.\nThe amendment also ensures that the person who is not a party to an appeal has an opportunity to be heard before such an order to pay costs is made.\nClause 12 amends section 33 to provide that where the value of any remaining land of a claimant for compensation is increased because of the use to which the land acquired will be put, that increase may be set-off only against the amount of compensation that would otherwise be payable for severing the claimant's land under section 33(1)(c), or for injurious affection under section 33(1)(d), or both, wherever applicable. The amendment will prevent setting-off against the other heads of compensation under section 33(1).\nClause 13 amends section 40 (relating to payment of compensation) to provide the circumstances where a Collector may apportion payment of compensation of any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to a strata title plan between the management corporation for the strata title plan and the subsidiary proprietors, instead of paying to the management corporation. Apportionment is permitted if, within 28 days after an award is made, the Collector receives a special resolution by the subsidiary proprietors referred to in section 85A(4) of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act.\nThe compensation will be paid to those who are subsidiary proprietors on the date possession is taken of the acquired land and distributed among them according to the share values of their respective lots.\nClause 14 amends section 49 to provide that before a management corporation can request for the whole of the land comprised in its strata title plan to be acquired, it must first obtain the agreement of the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation in the form of a resolution by consensus. Section 2(7) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act defines a resolution by consensus to be one where the motion that is the subject of the resolution is considered at a duly convened general meeting of the management corporation of which at least 21 days' notice specifying the notice is given, and where, at the end of 12 weeks after that general meeting is convened, all the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation support the motion in writing.\nClause 15 is a saving and transitional provision. The amendment to section 33 that is in clause 12 has a retrospective operative date of 7th July 2014. The amendment to section 33 will nevertheless not apply to land taken before 7th July 2014. All other amendments will not apply to or in relation to land taken before the operative date of these amendments.\nClause 16 read with the Schedule makes the following related amendments to the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA).\nSimilar definitions of \"non\u2010lot acquisition related expenses\" and \"non\u2010lot acquisition\" are introduced to section 2(1) BMSMA. The expression \"non\u2010lot acquisition related expenses\" is defined to refer to any legal costs, valuation and other professional fees reasonably incurred by a management corporation in relation to the preparation and filing of a claim for compensation under the Land\nAcquisition Act or an appeal under that Act, and any other financial costs reasonably incurred by the management corporation in convening and conducting meetings of its subsidiary proprietors for or in connection with the preparation and filing of such a claim for compensation or an appeal.\nSection 38(2) BMSMA is amended to provide that all moneys received by a management corporation from a Collector as an award of compensation under the\nLand Acquisition Act for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to its strata title plan must be paid into its management fund.\nNext, section 39(2) BMSMA is amended to provide that the sinking fund of a management corporation may be used to pay for its non\u2010lot acquisition related expenses.\nSection 47(1) BMSMA is amended to allow any subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee or prospective purchaser to request from a management corporation and inspect any notice under section 3, 8 or 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, or any copy of an award under section 10 of that Act, received by the management corporation for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan for which the management corporation is constituted. The amendment also requires the management corporation to certify whether it has received any such notice or award of compensation.\nA new section 47A BMSMA is introduced to impose a duty on the council of a management corporation to display on its notice board a copy of every notice under section 3, 8, 16 or any other provision under the Land Acquisition Act, or any award of compensation under section 10 of that Act, received by the management corporation for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan for which the management corporation is constituted, within 7 days after receipt and to keep thereafter displayed for a period of at least 14 days. In the event that there is no notice board for any reason, the new section 47A BMSMA requires the council of the management corporation to give each of the then subsidiary proprietors a copy of the notice or award within that period of 7 days.\nA new section 85A BMSMA is introduced to delimit a management corporation's capacity to represent its subsidiary proprietors in respect of a non\u2010lot acquisition relating to its strata title plan. The new section 85A(1) will require a management corporation to first obtain by ordinary resolution the agreement of its subsidiary proprietors before it can represent its subsidiary proprietors at any proceedings before the Appeals Board or Court of Appeal following any non\u2010lot acquisition. A management corporation for a strata title plan also cannot make a claim for compensation for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to\nits strata title plan unless authorised by ordinary resolution. Finally, the new section 85A(4) provides that the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation for a strata title plan may, by special resolution, agree that the compensation for any non\u2010lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan be distributed among themselves. In the event of such agreement, the compensation will be paid to the subsidiary proprietors in their respective shares after deducting, as is usual practice, for mortgages and charges in the order of their priorities.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

but\n(b) excludes any reference to sections 4(1), (4), (4A), (5) and (6), 5(1), (6), (7) and (8), 7, 8, 10(1), 13 and 28(3A),\n(4), (4A), (4B) and (6), and all other provisions that are rendered inapplicable by regulations made for the purpose of subsection (1)(b).\".\nAmendment of section 31\n6.

The principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the word \"trafficking\" in the long title and substituting the word \"dealing\";\n(b) by deleting the word \"trafficking\" wherever it appears in the\nfollowing provisions and substituting in each case the word \"dealing\":\nSections 3(1) and (2), 4(1), (2), (3), (3B), (4) and (4A), 5(8), 6(1), 7(1)(a) and (b) and (2) and section heading, 8(2), 9(1)(a) and (6) and section heading, 10(1) and (3), 12(7)(a) and (b), 13(2)(a) and (b)(ii), 14(4) and (5), 15(1)(a) and (c),\n(2) and (3)(b), 16(5)(b), 17(8), 19(1)(a) and (2)(a), 26(1) and (2), 27, 28(4), (4B)(b) and (5)(a), 30(1) and (4)(a), 34(1), (3)(a) and (4)(a) and (b), 42(7A)(b) and (8), 48A, 49(1) and 50(1) and (4)(b);\n(c) by deleting the word \"TRAFFICKING\" in the Part heading of\nPart II and substituting the word \"DEALING\";\n(d) by deleting the word \"TRAFFICKING\" in the Schedule heading of the First Schedule and substituting the word \"DEALING\"; and\n(e) by deleting the word \"trafficking\" in the headings of Parts I\nand II of the First Schedule and substituting in each case the word \"dealing\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious\nCrimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap. 65A) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to remove the existing requirement for a law of a foreign country to be evidenced by a certificate issued by or on behalf of the government of that country in order for the law to be regarded as a \"corresponding law\", or for an offence against that law to be regarded as a \"foreign serious offence\";\n(b) to extend the ambit of the terms \"criminal conduct\" and \"drug dealing\" to cover every type of money laundering offence under section 43, 44, 46 or\n(c) to align the definition of \"financial institution\" with the corresponding definition in the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186);\n(d) to enable certain types of foreign tax offences to be treated as foreign serious offences, whether or not the foreign tax concerned is of a type that is imposed in Singapore;\n(e) to extend legal professional privilege under the Act to legal counsel;\n(f) to establish a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office, and to confer certain additional powers on Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officers attached to that Office;\n(g) to enable the confiscation of property of a value corresponding to the value of the instrumentalities of a \"drug dealing offence\" or a \"serious offence\";\n(h) to exempt arbitrators from suspicious transaction reporting requirements;\n(i) to enable a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer to communicate certain information to an authority of a foreign country responsible for receiving that information, if that authority has given a unilateral undertaking to communicate to Singapore, upon Singapore's request, any such information received by that authority;\n(j) to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for the money laundering offences under sections 43, 44, 46 and 47 from 7 years to 10 years;\n(k) to provide for the amount of the cross\u2010border cash movement reporting threshold to be prescribed in subsidiary legislation, instead of being specified in the Act;\n(l) to implement a cash transaction reporting regime for certain persons involved in certain cash transactions;\n(m) to replace the references to \"seizable offence\" and \"non-seizable offence\" in section 55 with references to \"arrestable offence\" and \"non-arrestable offence\", respectively, for alignment with the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68);\n(n) to replace certain references in the Act to \"drug trafficking\", \"drug trafficking offence\" and \"foreign drug trafficking offence\" with references to \"drug dealing\", \"drug dealing offence\" and \"foreign drug dealing offence\", respectively, to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185); and\n(o) to make certain miscellaneous changes.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2(a) amends the definition of \"corresponding law\" in section 2(1) \u2014\n(a) to remove the existing requirement for a law of a foreign country to be evidenced by a certificate issued by or on behalf of the government of that country in order to be regarded as a \"corresponding law\"; and\n(b) to enable a law of a part of a foreign country (such as a state in a federation) to be a \"corresponding law\".\nClause 2(b) replaces the definition of \"criminal conduct\" in section 2(1). The existing definition of \"criminal conduct\" excludes from its ambit any act constituting a money laundering offence under section 44 or 47, and instead enumerates the types of money laundering that would constitute \"criminal conduct\". The new definition of \"criminal conduct\" extends its ambit to every act constituting a serious offence, which includes every type of money laundering offence under section 44 or 47.\nClause 2(c) amends the definition of \"defendant\" in section 2(1) to replace the reference in that definition to a \"drug trafficking offence\" with a reference to a \"drug dealing offence\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nClause 2(d) replaces the existing definitions of \"drug trafficking\" and \"drug trafficking offence\" in section 2(1) with new definitions for \"drug dealing\" and \"drug dealing offence\", respectively, as the references to \"drug trafficking\" and \"drug trafficking offence\" in the Act will be replaced with references to \"drug dealing\" and \"drug dealing offence\", respectively, to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The terms \"drug trafficking\" and \"drug dealing\" have different ambits. The existing definition of \"drug trafficking\" excludes from its ambit any act constituting a money laundering offence under section 43 or 46, and instead enumerates the types of money laundering that would constitute \"drug trafficking\". The new definition of \"drug dealing\" extends its ambit to every act constituting a drug dealing offence, which includes every type of money laundering offence under section 43 or 46.\nClause 2(d) also inserts a new definition for \"employer\" into section 2(1), as that term has an extended meaning when used in relation to a legal counsel.\nClause 2(e) replaces the definition of \"financial institution\" in section 2(1) to align that definition with the definition of \"financial institution\" in section 27A(6) of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act read with section 27A(7) of that Act.\nClause 2(f) replaces the existing definition of \"foreign drug trafficking offence\" in section 2(1) with a new definition for \"foreign drug dealing offence\", as the references to \"foreign drug trafficking offence\" in the Act will be replaced with references to \"foreign drug dealing offence\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The new definition of \"foreign drug dealing offence\" also clarifies that the offence must consist of or include conduct which, if the conduct had occurred in Singapore, would have constituted a drug dealing offence. This requirement is implied by the reference to \"drug trafficking offence\" in the existing definition of \"foreign drug trafficking offence\".\nClause 2(f) also replaces the definition of \"foreign serious offence\", and inserts a new definition for \"foreign serious tax offence\", in section 2(1).\n(a) The existing requirement for a law of a foreign country to be evidenced by a certificate issued by or on behalf of the government of that country in order for an offence against that law to be regarded as a \"foreign serious offence\" has been omitted from the new definition of \"foreign serious offence\".\n(b) A \"foreign serious tax offence\" is an offence against the national law of a foreign country that consists of the doing of any of certain specified acts wilfully with intent to evade, or to assist any other person to evade, any tax of that country. The specified acts are based on the elements of tax evasion under sections 96(1) and 96A(1) of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) and section 62(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap. 117A). The foreign tax that is being evaded need not be of a type that is imposed in Singapore.\nThe definition of \"foreign serious offence\" will be extended to include a \"foreign serious tax offence\". Consequently, a tax offence of a foreign country will be treated as a foreign serious offence if it falls within the definition of \"foreign serious tax offence\", whether or not the tax concerned is of a type that is imposed in Singapore.\nClause 2(g) inserts a new definition for \"legal counsel\" into section 2(1), as legal professional privilege under the Act will be extended to legal counsel.\nClause 2(h) inserts a new definition for \"possession\" into section 2(1), to clarify that the term \"possession\", when used in relation to any property (for instance, in sections 16, 19, 46 and 47), refers to the actual or constructive possession of the property. The new definition does not apply when the term \"possession\" is used in relation to other things.\nClause 2(i) amends section 2(2)(f) to replace the reference in that provision to a \"drug trafficking offence\" with a reference to a \"drug dealing offence\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs\nAct.\nClause 3 inserts a new section 2A to extend the ambit of references to \"item subject to legal privilege\" and \"items subject to legal privilege\" to include certain communications and items made, and certain documents prepared, in connection with a legal counsel giving advice to his employer, or in connection with and for the purposes of any legal proceedings in which the employer is or may be, or was or might have been, a party. Consequently, clause 7 deletes the existing definition of \"items subject to legal privilege\" in section 35(2), and clauses 6(b) and 8(c) delete sections 31(7) and 39(9) (which define \"items subject to legal privilege\" for the purposes of sections 31 and 39 by reference to the definition in section 35(2)), respectively.\nClause 4 inserts a new section 3A to establish a Suspicious Transaction\nReporting Office and to confer certain additional powers on Suspicious\nTransaction\nReporting\nOfficers attached to that\nOffice.\nThe\nSuspicious\nTransaction Reporting Office is the office of the Government which is responsible for the receipt and analysis of any thing disclosed, given, forwarded or submitted to, or filed with, a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer pursuant to a requirement under the new section 3A(3), pursuant to section 39(1), under section 48C(5), 48D or 48E(5) or the new section 48J(1) or under any regulations made under section 200 of the Casino Control Act (Cap. 33A). A Suspicious\nTransaction Reporting Officer attached to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting\nOffice may require any person to disclose any document or information for the purposes of any such analysis. A person who discloses any document or information to a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer pursuant to a requirement under the new section 3A(3) will not be treated as being in breach of any restriction upon disclosure imposed by law, contract or rules of professional conduct, and will not be liable for any loss arising out of the disclosure or any act or omission in consequence of the disclosure.\nClause 5 inserts a new Part IVA (comprising new sections 29A, 29B and 29C) to enable the confiscation of property of a value corresponding to the value of the instrumentalities of a drug dealing offence or a serious offence. Under the new\nPart IVA, a court may make a substitute property confiscation order if it is satisfied that a person convicted of a drug dealing offence or a serious offence had used or intended to use any property (the instrumentality) for the commission of the offence, and the instrumentality is not available for forfeiture. The new section 29A clarifies the scope of application of the new Part IVA. The new section 29B deals with the circumstances in which a substitute property confiscation order may be made and with related matters. The new section 29C applies Parts II, III and IV to a substitute property confiscation order with appropriate modifications.\nClause 6(a) and (c) amends section 31 (including the section heading) to replace the references in that section to \"drug trafficking\" and \"drug trafficking offence\" with references to \"drug dealing\" and \"drug dealing offence\", respectively, to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs\nAct.\nClause 8(a) amends section 39(1) to replace the reference in that provision to \"drug trafficking\" with a reference to \"drug dealing\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nClause 8(b) replaces section 39(4) to refine the list of persons currently exempted from the suspicious transaction reporting requirements in section 39, and to exempt, in addition to those persons, the following persons in the following circumstances from those requirements:\n(a) a legal counsel acting as such for his employer, or an interpreter or other person who works under the supervision of the legal counsel, in respect of any information or other matter concerning the employer which is an item subject to legal privilege (this being a consequence of the extension of the legal professional privilege under the Act to legal counsel);\n(b) an arbitrator in respect of any information or other matter which came to his attention in the course of any arbitral proceedings in which he acted as an arbitrator.\nClause 9 amends section 40A(4) to extend the protection conferred on an informer under section 40A to a person who makes a disclosure pursuant to a requirement of a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer under the new section 3A(3).\nClause 10(a) and (d) amends section 41(1) and (2)(a) to extend the types of information which a Suspicious Transaction Reporting Officer may communicate to a corresponding authority of a foreign country to include any thing disclosed pursuant to a requirement under the new section 3A(3), submitted under the new section 48J(1) or filed under any regulations made under section 200 of the Casino\nControl Act.\nClause 10(b) amends section 41(1)(i) to replace the reference in that provision to \"foreign drug trafficking offence\" with a reference to \"foreign drug dealing offence\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nClause 10(c) amends section 41(2)(a) to enable a Suspicious Transaction\nReporting Officer to communicate the information referred to in section 41(1) and (2)(a) to an authority of a foreign country responsible for receiving that information, if that authority has given a unilateral undertaking to communicate to Singapore, upon Singapore's request, any such information received by that authority.\nClause 11(a) and (c) amends section 43 (including the section heading) to replace the references in that section to \"drug trafficking\" with references to \"drug dealing\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nClauses 11(b), 12, 13(b) and 14 amend sections 43(5)(a), 44(5)(a), 46(6)(a) and 47(6)(a), respectively, to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for the money laundering offences under sections 43, 44, 46 and 47, respectively, from\n7 years to 10 years.\nClause 13(a) and (c) amends section 46 (including the section heading) to replace the references in that section to \"drug trafficking\" with references to \"drug dealing\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nClause 15 inserts a new section 47A to clarify that \u2014\n(a) it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the particulars of a predicate offence in order to prove that any property constitutes the benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct; and\n(b) it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that a person knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that any property constitutes or represents the benefits of an offence generally, in order to prove that the person knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the property constitutes or represents the benefits of drug dealing or criminal conduct.\nClause 16(a) and (b) inserts a new section 48(3A) and makes a consequential amendment to section 48(4) to enable a legal counsel acting as such for an employer, or a person who works under the supervision of the legal counsel, to disclose information to the employer in connection with the giving of legal advice, or to any person in connection with and for the purposes of legal proceedings concerning the employer, even if the disclosure of the information is likely to prejudice any investigation, proposed investigation or investigation which might be conducted (this being a consequence of the extension of the legal professional privilege under the Act to legal counsel).\nClause 16(c) amends section 48(6) to replace the references in that provision to \"drug trafficking\" and \"serious offence\" with references to \"drug dealing\" and \"criminal conduct\", respectively. The reference to \"drug trafficking\" is replaced with a reference to \"drug dealing\" to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The reference to \"serious offence\" is replaced with a reference to \"criminal conduct\" so that a person is not guilty of a tipping-off offence under section 48(1) or (2) in respect of anything done by him to enforce any provision of written law relating to criminal conduct (which extends, beyond conduct constituting a serious offence, to the doing, outside Singapore, of any act constituting a foreign serious offence).\nClauses 17 and 18 amend sections 48C and 48E, respectively, to provide for the amount of the cross-border cash movement reporting threshold (referred to in sections 48C(1) and 48E(1) as the \"prescribed amount\") to be prescribed in subsidiary legislation, instead of being specified in the Act. The existing sections 48C(4) and 48E(4) specify $30,000 (or its equivalent in a foreign currency) as the prescribed amount, but allow the Minister to specify, by notification in the Gazette, another amount in place of $30,000. Upon the deletion of sections 48C(4) and 48E(4) by clauses 17(b) and 18(b), respectively, the \"prescribed amount\" will be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under section 64, section 48C(6) (as amended by clause 17(c) to expressly enable the\nMinister to make regulations for all matters in section 48C) and the new section 48E(6) (which will be inserted by clause 18(c) to make section 48E structurally consistent with section 48C). Consequential to the deletion of sections 48C(4) and 48E(4), clauses 17(a) and 18(a) amend section 48C(1) and 48E(1), respectively, to clarify that the cross-border cash movement reporting requirements under sections 48C and 48E, respectively, also apply where cash in a foreign currency, the total value of which exceeds the equivalent of the prescribed amount in the foreign currency, is moved into or out from Singapore.\nClause 19 inserts a new Part VIB (comprising new sections 48H to 48K) to implement a cash transaction reporting regime for certain persons involved in certain cash transactions. The persons to be regulated, and the cash transactions to be reported, under the new Part VIB will be prescribed by regulations made under section 64. The regulations will also prescribe the customer due diligence measures and internal control measures to be performed by a prescribed person who engages in any prescribed cash transaction (or transactions) the value (or total value) of which exceeds the prescribed amount. In addition to such measures, a prescribed person will be prohibited from proceeding with certain prescribed cash transactions in certain circumstances, will be required to submit cash transaction reports relating to such prescribed cash transactions, and will be required to maintain certain records.\nThe new section 48H defines certain terms used in the new Part VIB. The new section 48I requires a prescribed person to perform the prescribed customer due diligence measures and internal control measures in certain circumstances, and provides for matters relating to such measures. The new section 48J requires a prescribed person to submit a cash transaction report to a Suspicious Transaction\nReporting Officer in certain circumstances, and provides for related matters. The new section 48K requires a prescribed person to maintain certain records.\nAs it may be necessary to criminalise the failure of a prescribed person to comply with certain prescribed measures, clause 22 inserts a new subsection (2) into section 64 to expressly empower the Minister to make regulations providing for a contravention of any specified provision of those regulations to be an offence punishable with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or with both. The maximum fine of $20,000 and the maximum imprisonment term of 2 years are pegged to the penalties for the offences under the new sections 48I(4), 48J(3) and 48K(3).\nClause 20 amends section 53 to provide for evidential matters relating to the proof of a corresponding law, or a law in relation to a foreign serious offence, in force in a part of a foreign country (such as a state in a federation).\nClause 21 amends section 55 to replace the references to \"seizable offence\" and \"non-seizable offence\" in that section with references to \"arrestable offence\" and \"non-arrestable offence\", respectively, for alignment with the Criminal Procedure\nCode.\nClause 23 makes miscellaneous amendments to the Act to replace certain references to \"drug trafficking\", \"drug trafficking offence\", \"drug trafficking offences\" and \"foreign drug trafficking offence\" with references to \"drug dealing\", \"drug dealing offence\", \"drug dealing offences\" and \"foreign drug dealing offence\", respectively, to avoid confusion with the term \"trafficking\" as defined in section 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.\n31",

and\n(b) there is no reasonable cause for the\nAuthority to believe that an offence under\nthis Act has been committed and the vehicle was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence.\"; and\n(k) by inserting, immediately before the definition of\n\"non-compliant personal mobility device\" in subsection (9), the following definition:\n\" \"non-compliant mobility vehicle\" has the meaning given by the\nActive\nMobility\nAct 2017;\".\nSaving and transitional provisions 8.\u2014(1) Section 5 applies to a non-compliant personal mobility device, non-compliant bicycle, non-compliant PAB or non-compliant mobility vehicle seized or surrendered under section 50 of the principal Act before the date of commencement of section 5, except\nthat a claim to the vehicle mentioned in section 51(2) of the principal\nAct as amended by this Act may be made not later than 30 days after the date of commencement of section 5(d).\n(2) Section 6(b) applies to a vehicle, an article or a thing moved to a holding yard under section 45 or 46 of the principal Act before the\ndate of commencement of section 6(b).\n(3) Section 7(a) to (i) applies to a non-compliant personal mobility device, non-compliant PAB or non-compliant mobility vehicle seized under section 95 or 95A of the Road Traffic Act before the date of commencement of section 7(e), except that a claim to a vehicle\nmentioned in section 95B(1) of the Road Traffic Act as amended by this Act may be made not later than 30 days after the date of commencement of section 7(e).\n(4) Any word or expression in this section that is defined in section 2(1) of the principal Act has the meaning given to it by that section.\n(5) For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of this\nsection, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of this section as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Active Mobility Act 2017 (Act 3 of 2017) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to extend the public path system to encompass certain open spaces that front, adjoin, abut or are connected to paths;\n(b) to enable the earlier disposal by the Land Transport Authority of\nSingapore (LTA) of non-compliant vehicles seized or removed to holding yards, where these vehicles are of such a nature or in such condition as would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody, or their detention in a holding yard materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the holding yard.\nThe Bill makes a similar amendment to section 95B of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) to enable the earlier disposal by the LTA of non-compliant vehicles seized where these are of such a nature or in such condition that would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody, or their detention in a place of safety materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the place of safety.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2(1) to introduce a new definition of \"path-connected open space\" so as to support the amendments in clauses 3 and 4.\nA \"path-connected open space\" has to relate to a path which may or may not already be declared a public path. The word means a courtyard, plaza, square, quadrangle, atrium, peristyle or other substantially level and unenclosed open space that is surfaced, is not a green verge or other area provided for the growing of grass, trees or other vegetation, that fronts, adjoins or abuts a path, or is connected to a path by stairs (which may even be moving stairs like an escalator), and is used or capable of being used as a means of access to and from the path by pedestrians from any direction.\nHowever, an area which has special or dedicated purposes that render the area (even if so connected) a destination in itself is not recognised as a path-connected open space.\nClause 2 also amends the definitions of \"footpath\", \"pedestrian-only path\" and \"shared path\" to refer to an area and not just a length of path, since path-connected open spaces can be of any shape. The definition of \"public path\" is also amended to include a path-connected open space as clause 4 will enable such a space to be declared a public path.\nClause 3 extends the definition of \"dedicated land\" in section 5 to include a path-connected open space.\nClause 4 amends section 6(1) firstly, to enable the LTA, by order in the Gazette, to declare a path-connected open space on public land (which includes dedicated land) or private land as a pedestrian-only path, a footpath or a shared path.\nClause 4 further amends section 6(5) to require the declaration of a public path (by order in the Gazette) to state not only when the public path is closed, but also when it is partly closed or used temporarily for a purpose other than as a path. This is to address path-connected open spaces which are occasionally used temporarily as fair grounds or other event venues. The public right of way on the closed parts of the path would be suspended then.\nClause 5 amends section 51 which presently relates to the forfeiture of vehicles seized under the Act and empowers the LTA to forfeit, without a court order in certain circumstances, a non-compliant personal mobility device (PMD), non-compliant bicycle or non-compliant power-assisted bicycle (PAB) seized.\nBy the amendments in clause 5, the circumstances are that the LTA is satisfied that an offence under the Act had been committed and the vehicle was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence, that at the end of 30 days after the date of the seizure or surrender, no permissible claim to the vehicle is earlier made in the prescribed manner to the LTA and that a person is convicted of the offence, or a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence had the offence compounded. A permissible claim is one made by someone who is not the person from whom the vehicle was seized or required to surrender the vehicle (or the latter person's agent). As is the case today, this is an opportunity for a third party to recover his or her vehicle used by another to commit an offence and seized or surrendered under the Act.\nBy the amendments in clause 5, the LTA is now allowed to order the forfeiture of a non-compliant mobility vehicle (like a motorised wheelchair or mobility scooter) that is either seized or surrendered under section 50. The seizure or surrender would have been on an order of an enforcement officer because the vehicle is reasonably believed to be a vehicle in connection with which an offence under Part 3, 3A or 4 of the Act is committed. This is in addition to the power to\nforfeit non-compliant PMDs, non-compliant bicycles and non-compliant PABs allowed under section 51 today.\nThe amendment also provides for forfeiture by the LTA before the end of the 30-day claim period and before a person is convicted of an offence under the Act involving that seized or surrendered vehicle, or a person has had that offence compounded.\nThe expedited procedure applies where the LTA considers that the seized or surrendered vehicle is of such a nature or in such condition that it would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody, or its detention in a holding yard materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the holding yard. It does not matter whether proceedings in respect of any offence are instituted.\nThis amendment is to address the fire risk presented by the high number of non-compliant models of PMDs and modified vehicles already seized or surrendered and presently being stored in holding yards. There are also many vehicles with damaged batteries due to accidents detained at holding yards. The present law does not take into account this danger as it requires a conviction or an offence compounded before these seized or surrendered vehicles may be disposed of under section 53.\nClause 6 amends section 53 (relating to the disposal of forfeited or surrendered vehicles) to provide an opportunity for objections to be made before the expedited forfeiture cases covered by the amendments in clause 5, are sold, destroyed or otherwise disposed of.\nThe LTA is required to give one month's notice before selling, destroying or otherwise disposing of forfeited vehicles. The amendment provides that if before the one-month period ends, the LTA receives a written objection to its intended sale, destruction or disposal (as the case may be) of a non-compliant PMD, non-compliant bicycle, non-compliant PAB or non-compliant mobility vehicle earlier seized (or surrendered) and forfeited due to danger under section 51 as amended by the Bill, the LTA has a discretion to direct that the vehicle be returned to the objector showing good cause why possession of the vehicle should be returned.\nHowever, releasing to an objector is impermissible if there is reasonable cause for the LTA to believe that an offence under the Act has been committed and the vehicle was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence.\nClause 6 also amends section 53 to enable an expedited sale or disposal of any non-compliant\nPMD, non-compliant bicycle, non-compliant\nPAB or non-compliant mobility vehicle moved to a holding yard under section 45 or\n46. The expedited process may be applied where the vehicle concerned is of such a nature or in such condition that it would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody, or its detention in a holding yard materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the holding yard.\nThe expedited process may be applied to a perishable article or thing that may rapidly depreciate in value, or an article or a thing of such a nature or in such condition that it would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody of the article or thing.\nHowever, if after the vehicle, article or thing has been sold, destroyed or disposed of but before the end of one year starting on the date the vehicle, article or thing was moved under section 45 or 46, a person who appears to be the owner of the vehicle, article or thing claims that vehicle, article or thing, the LTA may pay whatever balance remains of the value of the vehicle, article or thing when it was moved to a holding yard, after deducting from that value the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the LTA in moving, storing and selling, destroying or disposing of the vehicle, article or thing.\nClause 7 contains a related amendment to section 95B of the Road Traffic Act similar to that in clauses 5 and 6, with respect to non-compliant PABs, non-compliant PMDs and non-compliant mobility vehicles seized or taken to a place of safety under section 95 or 95A of the Road Traffic Act and which are of such a nature or in such condition that it would be dangerous for the LTA to retain custody, or their detention in a place of safety materially increases the likelihood of an outbreak of fire at the place of safety.\nClause 8 contains saving and transitional provisions dealing with vehicles, articles and things that have been seized, surrendered or forfeited before the respective operative dates of the amendments in clauses 5, 6 and 7.\nThe Minister is also conferred the power to prescribe additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of the amendments. The additional provisions are by way of regulations in the Gazette which must be made within a 2-year time limit.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The new section 40C provides for the making of regulations relating to institutions of a public character and Sector Administrators.\nClause 18 inserts a new section 46A to protect the Commissioner and other officers from liability for anything done or omitted to be done by them in good faith in the course of exercising any power, performing any function, or discharging any duty under the law.\nClause 19 amends section 47(1) to increase the maximum composition amount for offences under the Act and the regulations made thereunder.\nClause 20 inserts a new section 47A to provide for the prosecution of offences by public officers appointed by the Commissioner with the consent of the Attorney-\nGeneral.\nClause 21 amends section 48(2) to provide for additional regulations that may be made by the Minister, including regulations to prescribe the procedures and conditions for the registration of charities, and to provide for punishments for continuing offences.\nClause 22 provides for consequential amendments to other written laws. In particular, with the responsibility for approving and regulating institutions of a public character coming within the purview of the Commissioner of Charities under the\nCharities Act, corresponding provisions under the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) will be deleted or repealed. Likewise, references to \"Central Fund Administrators\" in the\nIncome Tax Act will be deleted in view of the introduction of \"Sector Administrators\" under the Charities Act.\nClause 23 is a transitional provision. It deems any approval granted to an institution of a public character under section 37(3) of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134) as an approval under the Charities Act after the amendments come into force. This serves to preserve the tax benefits applicable to the institution of a public character for the remainder of the duration for which the approval was earlier granted.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.\nCharities (Amendment)\nBill 2006\nSource\nProvision in\nCharities\nAct (Cap. 37) amended or inserted by this Bill\nSection Heading\nDraft UK\nCharities Bill dated 13 July\nIncome Tax\nAct (Cap. 134)\nCharities Act (Cap. 37)\nOthers\nSection\nClause\nSection\nSection\nLong title\nInterpretation\nAppointment of\nCommissioner of\nCharities and other officers\nObjectives and general functions of Commissioner\n(modified)\nCharity Council\n4B\nFunctions of\nCouncil\nRegistration of charities\nSupplementary provisions relating to audits,\netc.\nOffences\n25A\nPower to suspend or remove trustees, etc., from membership of charity\n(modified)\n26A\nPower to direct application of charity property\n(modified)\n26B\nPower to direct application of charity property after charity ceases to exist\n(modified)\nCharities (Amendment)\nBill 2006\nSource\nProvision in\nCharities\nAct (Cap. 37) amended or inserted by this Bill\nSection Heading\nDraft UK\nCharities Bill dated 13 July\nIncome Tax\nAct (Cap. 134)\nCharities Act (Cap. 37)\nOthers\nSection\nClause\nSection\nSection\nPersons acting as charity trustee while disqualified\nProfessional fund-raisers, etc., required to indicate institutions benefiting and arrangements for remuneration\nFalse statements relating to institutions which are not registered charities\nInterpretation of this Part [VIII]\n39(4) and (5) (modified)\n39A\nProhibition on conducting fund- raising appeal without permit\n39(1) to (3) (modified)\n39B\nPower of\nCommissioner to prohibit or restrict fund-raising appeal\nNew South\nWales\nCharitable\nFundraising\nAct 1991, section 31 (modified)\nExclusion of judicial review\n40A\nInterpretation of this Part [VIIIA]\n(modified)\n40B\nAppointment of\nSector\nAdministrators\n107(1)\n(modified)\nCharities (Amendment)\nBill 2006\nSource\nProvision in\nCharities\nAct (Cap. 37) amended or inserted by this Bill\nSection Heading\nDraft UK\nCharities Bill dated 13 July\nIncome Tax\nAct (Cap. 134)\nCharities Act (Cap. 37)\nOthers\nSection\nClause\nSection\nSection 40C\nRegulations relating to institutions of a public character and Sector\nAdministrators\n100(2) and 107(2) to (4) (modified)\n46A\nProtection from liability\nCasino\nControl Act (No. 10 of\n2006),\nsection 192 (modified)\nPower to compound\n47A\nProsecution of offences\nInland\nRevenue\nAuthority of\nSingapore\nAct (Cap. 138A), section 26(1) (modified)\nRegulations",

and\n(c) to remove certain unnecessary words in the definition of \"minor specialist building works\" in section 29A(1).\nClause 5 makes various amendments to the Casino Control Act (Cap. 33A) \u2014\n(a) to enable the police to conduct screenings of associates of casino operators and applicants for special employee licences at the request of the Casino\nRegulatory Authority of Singapore (the Authority), similar to that provided for in section 46(3) of that Act in relation to an applicant for a casino operator licence;\n(b) to enable the Authority to take a combination of the disciplinary actions referred to in section 93 of that Act against a special employee instead of only one of them, similar to that provided for in section 54(1) of that Act in relation to a casino operator;\n(c) to enable an appeal for reconsideration of an inspector's decision on a dispute between a casino operator and a patron of the casino to be conducted without the need for a physical hearing;

and\n(b) to remove the re-transmission or simultaneous transmission by digital means of a transmission referred to in paragraph (a) from the ambit of that section.\nThe clause also amends section 261D of the Copyright Act to enable the Minister, when making an order to allow the circumvention of a technological access control measure applied to any specified work or other subject-matter or performance, to also set out the purpose for which the circumvention may be carried out and the person who may carry out the circumvention. Further, the Minister's power to make the order is extended to a case where he is satisfied that a legitimate dealing with the work, subject- matter or performance is likely to be adversely impaired or affected by the prohibition on circumvention.\nClause 7 amends section 11(5) of the Health Sciences Authority Act (Cap. 122C) to include a definition of \"chemical metrology\" which was originally intended to be introduced by the amendment deleted by clause 2.\nClause 8 amends section 25(2) of the Land Surveyors Act (Cap. 156) to enable the\nLand Surveyors Board to take a combination of the disciplinary actions referred to in section 25(2) of that Act against a registered surveyor instead of only one of them.\nClause 9 makes various amendments to the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158) \u2014\n(a) to substitute the term \"approved company auditor\" in section 83 with \"approved liquidator\" (within the meaning of the Companies Act (Cap. 50)) as a person who may be appointed as a liquidator of a management corporation;\n(b) to correct a cross reference in section 84A(7C);\n(c) to disapply section 84E(14) to section 84F. Section 84E(14), which deems the landowner to be the proprietor of flats for which no lease has been granted, is inapplicable to section 84F which only applies in a case where all the proprietors of all the flats in the development who do not own the land have consented to the collective sale;\n(d) to disapply section 84FA(14) to section 84FB. Section 84FA(14), which treats the subsidiary proprietor in reversion to have transferred his estate and interests to those lots still owned by him to the purchaser in a collective sale, is inapplicable to section 84FB which only applies in a case where all the subsidiary proprietors of all the lots in the strata title plan have consented to the sale; and\n(e) to correct references to legislation in section 126B(1)(c), (e), (f), (g) and (h).\nClause 10 amends section 84(2) of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247) to enable regulations to be made under that Act for the establishment of advisory committees for the purposes of that Act.\nClause 11 repeals and re-enacts section 33 of the Terrorism (Suppression of\nFinancing) Act (Cap. 325) to clarify that the Extradition Act (Cap. 103) can be extended to all Convention countries (with respect to offences under the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism) with whom Singapore has in force extradition treaties, irrespective of when they come into force. Similar provisions (inserted for the same purpose) are found in the Terrorism (Suppression of\nBombings) Act 2007 (Act 50 of 2007) and the Internationally Protected Persons Act 2008 (Act 8 of 2008).\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

This Act may be cited as the Films (Amendment) Act 2009 and shall come into operation on such date as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint.\nAmendment of section 2\n2. Section 2 of the Films Act is amended \u23af\n(a) by inserting, immediately after the words \"any matter which\" in subsection (2)(a), the words \", in the opinion of the Board,\";\n(b) by deleting the words \"either partisan or biased references to or comments on any political matter, including but\" in subsection\n(2)(b) and substituting the words \"references to or comments on any political matter which, in the opinion of the Board, are either partisan or biased; and \"political matter\" includes but is\"; and\n(c) by deleting subsection (3) and substituting the following subsection:\n\"(3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), none of the following films shall be regarded for the purposes of this Act as a party political film:\n(a) a film which is made solely for the purpose of reporting of news by a broadcasting service licensed\nunder any written law;\n(b) a film which is made solely for the purpose of informing or educating persons on the procedures and polling times for any election or national referendum in Singapore;\n(c) a film which records live the whole or a material proportion of any performance, assembly of persons or procession that is held in accordance with the law and that does not depict any event, person or situation in a dramatic way;\n(d) a film designed to provide a record of an event or occasion that is held in accordance with the law for those who took part in the event or occasion or are connected with those who did so;\n(e) a documentary film without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate account depicting actual events, persons (deceased or otherwise) or situations, but not a film \u2014\n(i) wholly or substantially based on unscripted or\n\"reality\" type programmes; or\n(ii) that depicts those events, persons or situations in a dramatic way;\n(f) a film without animation and dramatic elements \u2014\n(i) composed wholly of a political party's manifesto\nor declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which candidates authorised by the political party to stand will seek to be elected at a parliamentary election; and\n(ii) made by or on behalf of that political party; and\n(g) a film without animation and dramatic elements \u2014\n(i) composed wholly of a candidate's declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which the candidate will seek to be elected at a parliamentary or presidential election; and\n(ii) made by or on behalf of that candidate.\".\nNew section 4A\n3. The Films Act is amended by inserting, immediately after section 4, the following section:\n\"Advisory committees\n4A.\u23af(1) The Minister may appoint one or more advisory committees to provide advice to the Board with regard to the performance of any of its functions in relation to any film.\n(2) Before making any decision under this Act in relation to a film and for the purpose of forming an opinion on which to base such\ndecision, the Board may consult with the relevant advisory committee in respect of the film but, in making such decision, shall not be bound by such consultation.\".\nAmendment of section 26\n4. Section 26 of the Films Act is amended by deleting subsection (1) and substituting the following subsection:\n\"(1) On receipt of an appeal under section 24, the Committee of\nAppeal may make an order \u23af\n(a) dismissing the appeal and confirming the decision of the\nBoard; or\n(b) reversing or varying the decision of the Board, including making such order as it thinks fit in regard to the approval for exhibition of any film which is the subject of appeal, the excision\nor retention of any part of any such film, and the classification of any film.\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Films Act (Cap. 107) to clarify the law relating to party political films and by liberalising the controls over such films.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 re-defines what would constitute a party political film. The Board of Film\nCensors (the Board) will decide whether the references to or comments on any political matter in a film are either partisan or biased, or whether the matter contained in the film is intended or likely to affect voting in any parliamentary or presidential election or any national referendum.\nThe list of films which are excluded from being regarded as party political films under section 2(3) is also expanded. The original list in section 2(3), comprising a film which is made solely for the purpose of reporting of news, and a film which is made solely for the purpose of informing or educating persons on the procedures and polling times for any election or national referendum in Singapore, is retained. Added to the list of exclusions are the following films:\n(a) a film which records live the whole or a material proportion of any performance, assembly of persons or procession that is held in accordance with the law and that does not depict events, persons or situations in a dramatic way. This may include live-recordings using devices like video- cams and cell phones of lawfully convened events such as election rallies, public speeches or processions;\n(b) a film designed to provide a record of an event or occasion that is held in accordance with the law for those who took part in the event or occasion or\nare connected with those who did so. Examples of these would be anniversary celebration videos by political parties;\n(c) a documentary film made without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate account depicting actual events, persons (deceased or otherwise) or situations. This includes any film whose setting and format is purely historical and that of a non-fictional documentary or biography. However, any reality film, or a film that depicts those events, persons or situations in a dramatic way will still not come within this exclusion. A propaganda film using a documentary format will not come within this exclusion. A film the creation of which involves the manipulation of audio or visual elements during editing so as to become an inaccurate or a dramatised record of events, persons or situations will not come within this exclusion;\n(d) a film made by a political party and that is the political party's manifesto or declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which candidates authorised to stand by the political party will seek to be elected at a parliamentary election; and\n(e) a film made by a candidate and that is the candidate's declaration of policies or ideology on the basis of which the candidate will seek to be elected at a parliamentary or presidential election.\nClause 3 inserts a new section 4A which empowers the Minister to establish one or more advisory committees to provide advice to the Board with regard to the performance of any of its functions in relation to any film. The Board may consult the relevant advisory committee before deciding but the Board is not bound to follow the advice of any of these advisory committees.\nClause 4 amends section 26 relating to appeals to the Committee of Appeal against the Board's decisions. On receipt of such an appeal, the Committee of Appeal may dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the Board, or vary the decision of the\nBoard. This includes classifying or re-classifying a film, with or without excisions or further excisions of the film.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The timber trade has since matured, and it has been in decline in recent years. Consistent with the de-regulation approach adopted towards other similar trade sectors, it is no longer necessary to regulate the timber trade in Singapore.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

and\n(b) to streamline and clarify some of the statutory processes for collective sales.\nThe Bill also seeks to make consequential and related amendments to the Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) and the Stamp Duties Act (Cap. 312).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 84A to primarily to provide for the transfer to the High\nCourt of applications for approval of collective sales of strata and other developments which cannot be successfully mediated by a Strata Titles Board and to re-define the role of the Strata Titles Boards to focus on mediation of such applications.\nFirstly, a new section 84A(2A) is inserted stating that every application for an order for the sale of all the lots and common property in a strata title plan (hereafter called a\ncollective sale application) must be made to a Strata Titles Board in the first instance.\nIf, after mediation by the Board of the application, a stop order is issued by the Board with respect to that application on account of there still being objections filed against that application, the subsidiary proprietors in favour of the collective sale may then apply to the High Court for approval.\nIf such an application is to be made to the High Court, new section 84A(2B) provides that it must be made within 14 days after the Board issued its stop order.\nObjections may be filed against the application to the High Court. This is to be done in the time and in the manner prescribed by the Rules of Court. Only objections from persons who had filed objections against the application to a Strata Titles Board and containing the same grounds of objections are permissible. Non-compliance with the\nSchedules to the Act will not be a basis for disputing the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear the application.\nWhere a collective sale application is made to a Strata Titles Board, and one or more objections have been filed in relation to that application, the Board must mediate matters that are in dispute between the objectors and the applicants. Under new section 84A(6A), the Strata Titles Board has a maximum of 60 continuous days to do so. If all objections to the application are withdrawn before the end of that period, the Strata\nTitles Board must approve the application and order the collective sale unless the Board is satisfied that the transaction is not in good faith after taking into account the factors listed in section 84A(9). Approval may be given regardless of there being subsidiary proprietors who have not signed the collective sale agreement but who have stayed silent and not filed any objections to the application.\nIf however, one or more of the objections filed against the application are not withdrawn at the end of the period of 60 days, the Strata Titles Board must order a discontinuance of all proceedings before it in connection with that application (referred to as a stop order).\nUnder new section 84A(6B), a stop order may be made by a Strata Titles Board with respect to a collective sale application after it has given notice to every objector who filed an objection to that application and the authorised representatives of the applicants, of its intention to make a stop order, and if, at the end of a period of 7 days after the notice was so served of those parties, one or more of those objections so filed remain not withdrawn.\nIn the case of a collective sale application to the High Court, where one or more objections have been filed in respect of the application, the High Court must approve the application and order that the flats and the land in the development be sold unless, having regard to the objections, the High Court is satisfied that any objector, being a subsidiary proprietor, will incur a financial loss, or the proceeds of sale for any flat to be received by any objector, being a subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee or chargee, are insufficient to redeem any mortgage or charge in respect of the flat. These are the same considerations a Strata Titles Board had to take into account prior to the amendments.\nBoth a Strata Titles Board and the High Court must, respectively, refuse a collective sale application before it if it is satisfied that the transaction is not in good faith after taking into account the sale price for the lots and the common property in the strata title\nplan, the method of distributing the proceeds of sale and the relationship of the purchaser to any of the subsidiary proprietors and not other factors, or it is satisfied that the sale and purchase agreement would require any subsidiary proprietor who has not agreed in writing to the sale to be a party to any arrangement for the development of the lots and the common property in the strata title plan.\nBy an amendment to section 84A(9)(b), the High Court may also refuse a collective sale application before it if the collective sale committee does not consent to any order made by the High Court that the proceeds of sale for any lot to be received by an objector to the collective sale application be increased.\nNext, section 84A(5) is also amended to expressly empower a Strata Titles Board and the High Court to request for any information or documents from any party related to a collective sale application before it, if the Board or High Court, as the case may be, deems such information relevant to aid it in its assessment of the collective sale application in accordance with section 84A(7) or (9)(a). Similar powers are conferred by new section 84A(5A) on the High Court in respect of collective sale applications.\nFinally, section 84A(11) is amended to make it clear that a Strata Titles Board and the High Court each have the power, in approving any collective sale application, to order or direct minority owners to share in the costs of the collective sale, notwithstanding that they did not sign the collective sale agreement. Clause 13(5) validates all such previous orders on costs made by a Strata Titles Board.\nClause 3 amends section 84B by abolishing the right of a subsidiary proprietor who has leased out his lot to apply to a Strata Titles Board to determine the amount of compensation payable to the lessee. In practice, most tenancy agreements already include clauses to deal with early termination in the event of a collective sale affecting the tenanted unit. The issue of compensation for the displaced lessee can easily be addressed through contractual arrangements between landlord and tenant. The power of a Strata Titles Board to arbitrate on such an issue is also incompatible with its re- defined role, which is a substantially mediation role where collective sale applications are concerned. Section 84B(3) is thus repealed.\nClause 4 amends section 84C as a consequence of the amendments to section 84A which allow collective sale applications to be made to the High Court.\nClause 5 amends section 84D in the same manner as section 84A with respect to collective sale applications concerning developments comprising subsisting leases of flats in a development registered under the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap. 269) or the\nLand Titles Act (Cap. 157) and the proprietors of the flats own the land comprised in the development.\nClause 6 amends section 84E in the same manner as section 84A with respect to collective sale applications concerning developments comprising subsisting leases of flats in a development registered under the Registration of Deeds Act or the Land Titles\nAct for a leasehold tenure of 850 years or more and where the proprietors of the flats do not own the land comprised in the development.\nClause 7 amends section 84FA in the same manner as section 84A with respect to collective sale applications concerning strata developments comprising subsisting\n31\nleases registered under the Land Titles Act (Cap. 157) of all or some of the lots in a strata title plan for a leasehold tenure of 850 years or more.\nClause 8 amends the First Schedule for the purpose of streamlining some of the procedures for keeping parties informed before a collective sale application is made.\nThe amendment to paragraph 1 will enable the notices mentioned therein to be sent by ordinary mail instead of being placed in mailboxes, as some mailboxes are locked to prevent junk mail and only the postal service has access to the mailboxes. This has made it difficult for collective sale committees to discharge some of their duties before a collective sale application can be made. The amendment to paragraph 14 is a consequence of the amendments to section 84A that re-define the role of the Strata\nTitles Boards.\nClause 9 amends the Second Schedule (relating to general meetings of management corporations for the purposes of collective sales) firstly, to discourage repeated attempts to convene general meetings so as to obtain the requisite consent of the subsidiary proprietors thereof to proceed with a collective sale. Amendments to paragraph 2 in this Schedule raise the level of support for a requisition for a general meeting of the management corporation to be held to discuss a collective sale, if the meeting is proposed to be held within 2 years of a previous failed attempt (called a \"relevant event\") happening on or after the date the amendments come into operation. The first requisition in that period of 2 years after a failed attempt must be made by at least 50% of the total number of subsidiary proprietors or by subsidiary proprietors owning at least 50% of the aggregate share values of all lots in the strata title plan, whereas a second or subsequent attempt within the 2 years must be made by at least 80% of the total number of subsidiary proprietors or subsidiary proprietors owning at least 80% of the aggregate share values of all lots in the strata title plan. For non-strata developments, the first requisition for a subsequent general meeting in the 2 years following a failed attempt must be made by at least 50% of the total number of proprietors of flats or proprietors who own at least 50% share of the land or 50% notional share of the land, as the case may be. In the case of non-strata developments, a second or subsequent attempt within the 2 years must be made by at least 80% of the total number of proprietors of flats or proprietors of flats who own at least 80% share of the land or 80% notional share of the land, as the case may be. A failed attempt means an instance where the quorum for a general meeting to discuss a collective sale is not met, when the motion for a collective sale is defeated at the general meeting, or the collective sale agreement expires without an application to a Board or the High Court being made or approved. A failed attempt also includes an instance where a collective sale committee stands dissolved by virtue of new paragraph 12(2) of the Third Schedule or an instance where all the members of a collective sale committee are removed without replacement.\nSecondly, amendments to paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule provide that a general meeting convened for the purposes of a collective sale will stand automatically dissolved if the quorum is not present within an hour after the start of the meeting. This is to ensure that there is sufficient representation from the subsidiary proprietors and flat owners to discuss issues connected with a collective sale of their development.\nClause 10 amends the Third Schedule (relating to composition, constitution and proceedings of collective sale committees) firstly, to elaborate on the types of interest and circumstances in paragraph 2 that may give rise to a conflict of interest between would-be members of a collective sale committee. The would-be member must declare that conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest at the general meeting before he is elected, and if he fails to do so, his election is void. A member of a collective sale committee must also declare to the chairperson of the collective sale committee, any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest within 7 days after he becomes aware of it. For any serving member of collective sale committees when the amendments come into force, he has 30 days after the operative date of the amendments to make the declaration. The collective sale committee has then to affix notice of that declaration on a conspicuous part of each building comprised in the strata title plan or development, within 7 days of the making of that declaration.\nSecondly, the Third Schedule is amended to empower a collective sale committee to remove any member of the committee if the member is a subsidiary proprietor who has not signed the collective sale agreement and an application has been made to a Strata\nTitles Board for approval of that collective sale. Once the requisite level of support has been obtained for a collective sale application to be made to a Strata Titles Board and the application is made, a member of the collective sales committee who has refused to sign the collective sale agreement ceases to have any relevant role on the collective sale committee.\nThe next amendment to paragraph 8 of the Third Schedule deals with strata developments where there are only 2 subsidiary proprietors. Both of them will be members of the collective sale committee, but there can be situations where the committee is deadlocked since the collective sale committee makes decisions by a simple majority of the number of persons present. Paragraph 8 is amended to provide that in such a situation where there are only 2 subsidiary proprietors, the collective sale committee's decision will be based on the decision of the subsidiary proprietor who owns more than 50% of the aggregate share value of all lots in the strata development.\nThe fourth set of amendments seeks to streamline the processes for a collective sale committee. Presently, general meetings are required for updates pertaining to the consent level, the sale proposal and process, the number of bids and bid amounts, and the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase agreement with the eventual buyer.\nAs no decision is required of the subsidiary proprietors, paragraph 7 of the Third\nSchedule is amended to do away with the requirement to convene a general meeting of the management corporation for these purposes. The updates will instead be required to be done by way of meetings among the subsidiary proprietors.\nThe last amendment is to paragraph 12 of the Third Schedule to clarify that, in the case where a collective sale committee has not received any signatories to its collective sale agreement within a period of 12 months after it is constituted, the collective sale committee will be automatically dissolved. For collective sale committees in existence when the amendment takes effect, the period is 12 months after the date the amendment comes into force. This amendment does not prevent the subsidiary proprietors from earlier dissolving the collective sale committee at a general meeting.\nClause 11 makes amendments to sections 13(2)(a) and 92(1) of the Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) which are consequential to the re- defined role of the Strata Titles Board vis-\u00e0-vis collective sale applications. Section 47 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act is also amended to require a management corporation for a strata title plan to furnish a collective sale committee strata roll information concerning the various lots comprised in the strata title plan upon application by the collective sale committee and payment by the committee of the prescribed fee.\nClause 12 makes consequential and related amendments to sections 22 and 24 of the\nStamp Duties Act (Cap. 312). Section 22(6) and (9) is amended to update the cross- references therein. Section 24(2) is repealed so as to abolish the payment of stamp duty upon severance of interests under a joint tenancy. The Court of Appeal had ruled in\nDiaz Priscillia v Diaz Angela [1998] 1 SLR 367 held that there is no passing of any interest upon the severance of a joint tenancy.\nClause 13 is a saving and transitional provision.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 97ZC(2) of the principal Act is amended by deleting the words \"or (2B)\" in paragraph (b) and substituting the words \", (2B) or (2BAA)\".\nRepeal and re-enactment of section 97ZH and new\nsection 97ZHA\n13. Section 97ZH of the principal Act is repealed and the following sections substituted therefor:\n\"Prohibition against selling, leasing out or disposing of qualifying equipment\n97ZH.\u2014(1) Except as permitted under subsection (2), a company must not sell, lease (except to the project company) or otherwise dispose of any qualifying equipment in respect of which an IIA has been given to the company, during the qualifying period of the equipment and within 2 years after the\nend of such qualifying period.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the company obtains the written approval of the Minister for the sale, lease or disposal.\nRecovery of IIA 97ZHA.\u2014(1) Where a company has contravened section 97ZH(1) or failed to comply with any term or condition specified in the approval letter issued to the\ncompany, an amount equal to the whole of the IIA given in respect of a qualifying equipment must be recovered in the following manner:\n(a) where the IIA given had been credited to the normal\nIIA account \u2014\n(i) the amount of the IIA must be deducted from that account; and\n(ii) where the credit in that account is insufficient to enable full recovery of the IIA, an assessment or additional assessment in respect of the shortfall\nmust, subject to section 74 of the Income Tax\nAct (Cap. 134), be made upon the company;\n(b) where the IIA given had been credited to the concessionary IIA account \u2014\n(i) the amount of the IIA must be deducted from\nthat account; and\n(ii) where the credit in that account is insufficient to enable full recovery of the IIA, an assessment or additional assessment in respect of the shortfall must, subject to section 74 of the Income Tax\nAct, be made upon the company.\n(2) The Minister may waive, wholly or partly, the recovery of the IIA under subsection (1).\".\nValidation 14.\u2014(1) This section applies to any substitution made by the\nMinister, before the date of commencement of section 6, of the concessionary rate of tax specified in a certificate issued to a development and expansion company for expansion income derived from any qualifying activity, with another concessionary rate.\n(2) Every substitution mentioned in subsection (1) is, and is taken always to have been, by force of this section, validly made; and no legal proceedings may be instituted on or after 8 January 2018 in any court on account of or in respect of any such substitution.\n(3) The collection and recovery of any tax, or any other thing done, before the date of commencement of section 6 on the basis of the substituted rate is, and is taken always to have been, by force of this section, validly done under the principal Act and the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134).\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from\nIncome Tax) Act (Cap. 86) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to remove prescribed intellectual property income from the tax incentive scheme for pioneer service companies under Part III of the\nAct;\n(b) to remove prescribed intellectual property income from the tax incentive scheme for development and expansion companies under\nPart IIIB of the Act;\n(c) to expressly enable the Minister to substitute the concessionary rate of tax given to a development and expansion company for any qualifying activity or activities with a concessionary rate of either 5% or 10%;\n(d) to extend the last day for the Minister to extend the tax relief period of a relevant development and expansion company for a qualifying activity from 17 February 2018 to 31 December 2023;\n(e) to bring forward the last day for the Minister to approve a development and expansion company for international legal services from 31 March 2020 to 30 June 2017;\n(f) to extend the scheme for integrated investment allowance in Part XIIID of the Act to certain equipment that is primarily used for manufacturing any product or providing specialised engineering or technical services in an approved project.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 3 to insert the definition for the term \"intellectual property income\" to support the amendments in clauses 5 and 9.\nClause 3 amends section 8 by deleting and substituting the section heading with a new section heading, to more accurately reflect the subject of the section.\nClause 4 amends section 15(2) and (3) to clarify that the balance of any loss which remains unabsorbed on the tax relief expiry date of the old trade or business is only available as a deduction for the year of assessment which relates to the basis period in which the new trade or business commences.\nClause 5 inserts a new section 19A to provide that in ascertaining the income of a pioneer service company from a qualifying activity under section 10 (as applied by section 19), any intellectual property income produced by the activity, as well as any allowance for capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of that activity that is attributable to or apportioned by the Comptroller of Income Tax (the\nComptroller) to any intellectual property income, must be excluded. The excluded income remains chargeable to tax under the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134). The clause also provides that for the purposes of the application of section 15, a reference to income in section 15(1) excludes any intellectual property income.\nClause 6 inserts a new subsection (5DA) into section 19J to expressly enable the\nMinister to amend a certificate issued to a development and expansion company by substituting the concessionary rate of tax specified in the certificate for any qualifying activity or activities, with a concessionary rate of either 5% or 10%.\nThe clause also inserts new subsections (5EA), (5EB) and (5EC) into section 19J to provide for substitutions to be made in respect of a development and expansion company that is approved as such on or after 29 February 2012, or that has been granted an extension of its tax relief period for any qualifying activity on or after that date.\nThe examples below illustrate the operation of the new section 19J(5EA), (5EB) and (5EC).\nTaxpayer (A) is approved as a development and expansion company for a qualifying activity for an initial tax relief period of 10 years. The concessionary tax rate for that period is 5%. The tax relief period is then extended for another 5 years and the concessionary tax rate specified for that extension, in accordance with section 19J(5E), is 5.5%. The tax relief period is given a second extension of\n3 years and the concessionary tax rate specified for the second extension (which begins on the first day of the 16th year and ends on the last day of the 18th year), in accordance with section 19J(5E), is 6%.\nExample 1\nOn the first day of the 17th year of the tax relief period, the concessionary tax rate of 6% is substituted under the new section 19J(5EA). Applying the new section 19J(5EA),\n(5EB) and (5EC), and assuming that the\nMinister determines 10% to be the value of \"B\" under the new section 19J(5EC), the concessionary tax rate applicable to the expansion income derived by A from the qualifying activity in the tax relief period after the second extension is as follows:\nFrom the beginning of the 16th year of the tax relief period to the day before the date of the substitution\nFrom the date of the substitution to the end of the 18th year of the tax relief period\n11%\nThe rate of 6% in the second column of the table is the initial rate that applies pursuant to section 19J(5EB)(b)(i).\nThe rate of 11% in the second column of the table is the substituted rate that applies pursuant to section 19J(5EB)(b)(ii), arrived at by totalling 10% (being the value of \"B\" determined by the Minister) and 1%. 1% is the difference between the sums mentioned in sub\u2010paragraphs (i) and (ii) of section 19J(5EC)(a).\nThe sum in sub\u2010paragraph (i) of section 19J(5EC)(a) is 11.5%. This sum is arrived at by adding the concessionary tax rate that applies to the company's expansion income from that activity on the first day of the 11th year of the tax relief period for that activity (5.5%), and the concessionary tax rate that applies on the first day of the 16th year of the tax relief period (6%).\nThe sum in sub\u2010paragraph (ii) of section 19J(5EC)(a) is 10.5%. This sum is arrived at by adding the concessionary tax rate that applies on the day immediately before the first day of the 11th year of the tax relief period (5%), and the concessionary tax rate that applies on the day immediately before the first day of the 16th year of the tax relief period (5.5%).\nExample 2\nThe rate of 6% is substituted under the new section 19J(5EA) on the first day of the second extension of the tax relief period.\nApplying the new section 19J(5EB)(a), the concessionary tax rate applicable to the expansion income derived by A from the qualifying activity in the tax relief period after the second extension is 11%, derived in the same way as the substituted rate in\nExample 1.\nClause 7 amends section 19K(3C) to extend the last day for the Minister to extend the tax relief period of a relevant development and expansion company for a qualifying activity, from 17 February 2018 to 31 December 2023.\nClause 8 amends section 19KA(1) to bring forward the last day for the Minister to approve a development and expansion company for international legal services, from 31 March 2020 to 30 June 2017.\nClause 9 amends section 19M(1) and inserts new subsections (1A) and (1B).\nThe new subsection (1A) sets out the existing requirement that in ascertaining the qualifying income of a development and expansion company from a qualifying activity or qualifying activities in accordance with the provisions of the Income\nTax Act, adjustments as may be necessary to give effect to any direction under section 19P must be made. The new subsection (1A) also sets out a new requirement that in conducting such ascertainment, intellectual property income must be deducted from the company's income from the qualifying activity or activities. The new subsection (1B) provides that the deducted income remains chargeable to tax under the Income Tax Act.\nThe clause also inserts a new subsection (2A) into section 19M to provide that in subsection (2), a reference to allowances for capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of a qualifying activity excludes any such allowance attributable to or apportioned by the Comptroller to intellectual property income.\nClause 10 amends section 97ZA to expand the definition of \"qualifying equipment\" to include equipment that is primarily but not solely used for specified purposes in an approved project. The existing definition continues to apply to projects that are approved before 21 February 2017, whereas the expanded definition applies to projects that are approved on or after 21 February 2017.\nClause 11 amends section 97ZB \u2014\n(a) to provide for the calculation of integrated investment allowance in respect of fixed capital expenditure for an approved project, taking into account the expanded definition of \"qualifying equipment\" in section 97ZA (as amended by clause 10);\n(b) to enable the Minister to, in the Minister's discretion, amend an approval letter by adding to, removing or substituting any matter required to be specified in the approval letter under subsection (4); and\n(c) to extend the last day for the Minister to approve a project for the purposes of Part XIIID from 28 February 2017 to 31 December 2022.\nClause 12 makes an amendment to section 97ZC(2) that is consequential to the insertion, by the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2014 (Act 37 of 2014), of a new subsection (2BAA) into section 19A of the Income Tax Act.\nClause 13 repeals and re-enacts section 97ZH with an amended section 97ZH and inserts a new section 97ZHA. The amended section 97ZH reproduces the prohibition against selling, leasing or disposing of any qualifying equipment in respect of which an integrated investment allowance has been given. The new section 97ZHA expands the circumstances in which recovery of the integrated investment allowance given to a company will take place. The circumstances now include a contravention of section 97ZH(1) (as amended by the clause), as well as a failure by a company to comply with any term or condition specified in the approval letter issued to the company. Section 97ZHA also sets out the mechanism for the recovery of integrated investment allowance that is currently set out in section 97ZH.\nClause 14 is a validation provision for any substitution, made by the Minister to the concessionary rate of tax specified in a certificate issued to a development and expansion company for any qualifying activity or activities, with another concessionary rate before the date of commencement of clause 6. The clause also validates the collection and recovery of any tax, or any other thing done, under the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act and the Income\nTax Act on the basis of the rate as substituted before the date of commencement of clause 6.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

Section 19 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \"service or\" in paragraph (b);\n(b) by deleting the word \"and\" at the end of paragraph (b); and\n(c) by deleting the full-stop at the end of paragraph (c) and substituting a semi-colon, and by inserting immediately thereafter the following paragraphs:\n\"(d) prescribing the procedure to be followed by the Council on receiving representations about restraining orders and when making recommendations to the President;\n(e) requiring the making, keeping and auditing\nof records of religious donations and anonymous donations received and accepted by religious groups, and requiring and otherwise providing for the production, examination and copying of\nthose records;\n(f) requiring the making and keeping of records of affiliations, and the responsible officers and governing bodies of religious groups, and requiring and otherwise\nproviding for the production, examination and copying of those records;\n(g) the creation of offences which shall be punishable with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or with imprisonment for a term\nnot exceeding 12 months or with both;\n(h) for any matter necessary, permitted or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act; or\n(i) matters of a saving or transitional nature consequent on amendments to the regulations.\".\nNew sections 20 and 21\n16.

Section 17F(1), (2), (3) or (4) Inciting hatred, ill-will, etc.\n(b) by deleting the words \"religious or\" in the second column of item 211; and\n(c) by deleting the words \"religion or\" in the second column of item 212.\n(4) The Second Schedule to the Registration of Criminals Act\n(Cap. 268, 1985 Ed.) is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \"religion or\" in the item relating to \"Section 298A\" in Part IA; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after the item relating to \"Immigration Act\" in Part II, the following item:\n\"Cap. 167A\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony Act ...\nSections 17E, 17F and 17G.\".\nSaving and transitional provision 19.\u2014(1) Sections 5, 6, 8 and 9 do not apply to or in relation to \u2014\n(a) any restraining order made before the date of commencement of sections 5 and 6; and\n(b) any proceedings relating to or following a notice of intention to make a restraining order given under sections 8(4) and 9(4) of the principal Act before the date of commencement of sections 5 and 6,\nand the principal Act as in force immediately before the date of commencement of sections 5 and 6, respectively, continue in force with respect to those restraining orders and proceedings as if this Act were not enacted.\n(2) Despite section 18(2), item 19 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to\nthe Criminal Procedure Code as in force immediately before the date of commencement of section 18(2) continues to apply with respect to any offence under section 298 of the Penal Code committed before that date.\n(3) For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any\nprovision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that provision as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (Cap. 167A) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to improve the process for the making of restraining orders so that these may be made and take effect more quickly without modifying the role of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony (called the\nPCRH);\n(b) to provide for additional restraining orders to be applied to religious groups so as to pre-empt, prevent or reduce any foreign influence affecting the religious groups which may undermine religious tolerance between different religious groups in Singapore and present a threat to the public peace and public order in Singapore;\n(c) to introduce requirements for religious groups in the areas of donations, the nationality of their responsible officers and the composition of their governing bodies so as to contribute to keeping\nthe affairs of religious groups and inter-religious relations in Singapore free from harmful foreign influence;\n(d) to consolidate offences involving religious vilification.\nThe Bill also makes consequential and related amendments to the Penal Code (Cap. 224), the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68), the Mutual Assistance in\nCriminal Matters Act (Cap. 190A) and the Registration of Criminals Act (Cap. 268).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 to introduce several new definitions to support the amendments in the subsequent clauses. These are \"donation\", \"religious donation\" and \"relevant donor\".\nA key definition is that of \"donation\". This has been defined to refer only to donations in terms of money, and not money's worth. Hence, a donation of land or religious art, jewellery or books is not treated as a donation. Volunteer services by professionals, floral arrangements or free musical performances are also not regarded as donations even though for the benefit of a religious group. A pledge of moneys or royalties is also not a donation until the money is received. A cheque would, however, be a donation covered by the Bill.\nA \"donation\" to a religious group is defined as any bequest or gift of money to the religious group or any religious institution affiliated or associated with the religious group, any money to pay or reimburse any expenditure incurred (whether directly or indirectly) by the religious group or any religious institution affiliated or associated with the religious group, or any money lent to the religious group or any religious institution affiliated or associated with the religious group otherwise than on commercial terms.\nExpressly excluded from the definition of \"gift\" are zakat and fitrah, which are regulated under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 3). The Minister may, by regulations made under section 19, exclude other sums of money.\nNot all donations to a religious group are subject to controls under the amendments in the Bill. Only religious donations and anonymous donations are subject to control.\nAn \"anonymous donation\", for a religious group, is defined to mean a donation which the religious group accepting the donation is (whether because the donation is offered anonymously or by reason of deception or concealment) unable to ascertain the identity of the donor giving the donation. However, excluded from the definition are a donation deposited in a box, receptacle or other container in a publicly accessible location within a place of worship in Singapore for the same religion or religious denomination as the religious group, and any proceeds from a collection by the religious group, the conduct of which is authorised by the House to House and Street Collections Act (Cap. 128).\nAlso excluded from the definition of \"anonymous donation\" are cash donations collected during an act of collective worship or a religious ceremony or rite conducted by the religious group. A pledge of a share of a person's salary is not a cash donation which is excluded for this purpose. The Minister may by regulations declare other types of otherwise anonymous donations from being treated as such and exclude these from the scope of the amendments in the Bill.\nThe term \"religious donation\" is defined to mean a donation made to or for the benefit of the religious group, the whole or part of which was used or is intended to be used by the religious group solely or substantially for carrying out a religious or charitable purpose of the religious group wholly or partly in Singapore, or to enable the religious group to make, directly or indirectly, a religious donation or to incur expenditure for carrying out any of its religious or charitable purposes wholly or partly in Singapore. The Bill provides a number of examples of what would be a religious or charitable purpose.\nAs the Act and the amendments in the Bill draw a distinction between religious leaders and non-religious leaders, clause 2 defines \"religious leader\" to mean a priest, monk, pastor, mufti, imam, rabbi, elder or similar office-bearer in a religious group or religious institution. It also includes any other person who is in a position of authority in any religious group or religious institution in relation to the religious practice or worship, or the tenets of the religion or religious denomination of that group or institution. The latter could include a lay leader or preacher of a religious group or religious institution so long as the person holds a position of authority in relation to the religious practice, worship or tenets of the religion or religious denomination of that group or institution.\nHowever, a person is not automatically a religious leader just because the person is a responsible officer of the religious group or a member of the governing body of the religious group. For example, if the responsible officer or governing body member is not holding any of the offices mentioned in the definition or any position of authority in those matters, but merely serves as a treasurer or serves regularly as a member of the choir or a musician at worship ceremonies, the responsible officer or governing body member is not a religious leader.\nThe Bill contains amendments capable of applying to conduct occurring outside\nSingapore. The expression \"engaging in conduct\" is used in the context of the new offences and the community remedial initiative in the new section 16H. This is defined to mean an act or omission on a single occasion as well as a series of acts or omissions, or both, on a number of occasions over a period of time, and may include conduct occurring outside Singapore. Communications activity is expressly described as engaging in conduct.\nFinally, an important definition of a term used in the amendments in the Bill relating to restraining orders and offences, is the expression \"communications activity\". \"Communications activity\" is defined by an amendment in clause 2 to refer to communicating or distributing the information or material to the general\npublic or a section of the general public in Singapore, whether or not in the course of business. The definition expressly includes doing any of the following, whether or not in the course of business:\n(a) placing the information or material, or something that contains the information or material, somewhere it can be accessed by another in the general public or a section of the general public in Singapore;\n(b) giving the information or material, or something that contains the information or material, to an intermediary to give to an intended recipient in the general public or a section of the general public in\nSingapore;\n(c) describing to the general public or a section of the general public in\nSingapore how to obtain access, or methods that are likely to facilitate access, to the information or material, or something that contains the information or material (for example, setting out the name of a website, a URL, a password or the name of a newsgroup);\n(d) displaying, screening or playing the information or material, or something that contains the information or material, so that it can be seen or heard in or from a public place in Singapore.\nThe definition therefore covers modes of communication in the digital and traditional environments.\nAs defined, private speech does not become communications activity just because it occurs in a public place. Also not regarded as undertaking communications activity is an intermediary which communicates or distributes in the course of business information or material produced entirely by another and without altering the substance of the information or material.\nClause 3 introduces 2 new sections. First, the new section 2A contains provisions required to support the amendments relating to donations to religious groups in clause 13, as well as to deal specially with communications activity involving information or material in electronic or digital form.\nThe new section 2A provides that anything given or transferred to any branch of a religious group (which may be a religious institution) will be treated as given or transferred to the religious group under the Act as amended by the Bill.\nLikewise, anything given or transferred to any responsible officer of a religious group, member of the governing body of a religious group, or to a religious leader of a religious group in his or her capacity as such will be treated as given or transferred to the religious group.\nHowever, where the donation is given or transferred to a responsible officer, member of the governing body or religious leader in that capacity but is solely for his or her own use or benefit, the donation will not be treated as received by the religious group.\nUnder the new section 2A, a donation is accepted by a religious group if it is received and retained by the religious group for its use and benefit.\nThe new section 2A(3) and (4) then goes on to deal with the situation where the information or material in electronic or digital form does not originate in\nSingapore or the origin of which cannot be determined. The provision deems that the information or material will still be treated as communicated or distributed to the general public in Singapore if the information or material is communicated or distributed or caused to be communicated or distributed by a Singapore-connected person or the Singapore-connected person takes part in that communication or distribution, and the information or material is accessible by persons physically present in Singapore.\nNext, the new section 2B provides for the appointment by the Minister of a public officer as a competent authority. There can be different competent authorities for different provisions of the Act.\nClause 4 amends section 4 in connection with the functions and proceedings of the PCRH, to clarify that the PCRH makes recommendations to the President with regard to restraining orders.\nClause 5 amends section 8, relating to restraining orders against religious leaders or a member of a religious group or religious institution.\nThe circumstances under which a restraining order may be made are modified.\nToday, the Minister may make a restraining order against a religious leader or a member of a religious group or religious institution where the Minister is satisfied that that person has committed or is attempting to commit certain acts. The amendments expand this to include the circumstance where the Minister is satisfied that the religious leader or member of a religious group or religious institution (as the case may be) is committing, has committed or is likely to commit, or has attempted or is attempting to commit any of those acts.\nSection 8 is also amended to empower the making of restraining orders against religious groups so as to counter foreign influence over the affairs of religious groups. A restraining order under the new section 8(1A) can be made by the\nMinister if the Minister is of the opinion that it is necessary or expedient so as to pre-empt, prevent or reduce any foreign influence affecting the religious group which may undermine religious tolerance between different religious groups in\nSingapore, and present a threat to the public peace and public order in Singapore.\nThe clause also amends section 8(2) to expand on the content of any restraining order against a religious leader or a member of a religious group or religious institution, having regard to modes of communication today. A restraining order can require the religious leader, or member of a religious group or religious institution, against whom the order is made to stop undertaking any communications activity involving the information or material specified or described in the order, immediately or within the period specified in the order, and\nabsolutely or except with the prior permission of the Minister. This is defined to include taking all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that the information or material is no longer available on or through the Internet to end users in Singapore, such as (if necessary) the removal of the information or material from an online location.\nToday, a restraining order can require the religious leader or member of a religious group or religious institution to stop printing or editing, or assisting or contributing to, any publication produced by any religious group without the prior permission of the Minister. The amendment expands the power to include a publication produced by any religious institution.\nWhere the restraining order is made against a religious group under the new section 8(1A), the restraining order can require the religious group to not accept any anonymous donation, to not accept any religious donation from a foreign principal specified in the order, to return any religious donation received, on or after a date specified in the order, from a foreign principal specified in the order, or to dispose of any anonymous donation received, on or after a date specified in the order. The restraining order may specify the manner in which, and has to set out the period within which, the religious donations concerned must be sent back to the person who made the donation or any other person appearing to be acting on the donor's behalf.\nIf a restraining order under the new section 8(1A) requires an anonymous donation to be disposed of, then where the donation was transmitted by a person (other than the donor) and the identity of that person is apparent, the whole donation must be returned to that person. Where it is apparent that the donor has, in connection with the donation, used any facility provided by an identifiable financial institution, the whole donation must then be returned to that financial institution. In all other cases, the whole donation must be sent to a competent authority. All anonymous donations sent to a competent authority must then be paid into the Consolidated Fund.\nA restraining order under the new section 8(1A) can also pertain to the composition of the governing body of a religious group. The order may require the religious group to ensure that on or after a date specified in the order, every member of the governing body of the religious group is a citizen of Singapore or require the religious group to remove a member of the governing body of the religious group specified in the order, being an individual who is not a citizen of\nSingapore. The restraining order can also suspend (not exceeding 24 continuous months) a member of the governing body of the religious group who is not a citizen of Singapore from the exercise of his or her office as a member of the governing body pending his or her removal under the restraining order.\nA restraining order under the new section 8(1A) can only apply after the requirements in the new sections 16D and 16E are triggered. The amendments\nhere may therefore be brought into force on a separate date from the other amendments to section 8.\nClause 5 also changes the process for making a restraining order to enable action to be taken quickly to address tensions between religious groups, stop subversive activities or the carrying out of activities to promote a political cause while or under the guise of propagating or practising any religious belief, etc.\nUnder the amendments, the Minister is not required to give any person notice, or consult any person, before making any restraining order under section 8(1) or (1A). Under present law, before making a restraining order, the Minister has to give the person against whom the order is proposed to be made and the head or governing body of the religious group or institution notice of the Minister's intention to make the order, and give them 14 days to make written representations to the Minister.\nUnder the amendments, the Minister is required after making a restraining order under section 8(1) or (1A) against a religious leader of any religious group or religious institution or a member thereof, or a religious group (as the case may be), to immediately give, or cause to be given, a copy of the order, and the grounds, facts and documents supporting the order, to the religious leader or member or the religious group against whom the order is made, and the head or governing body of that religious group or religious institution.\nThe clause further amends section 8 to provide that a restraining order made by the Minister under section 8(1) or (1A) against a religious leader of a religious group or religious institution or a member thereof, or a religious group, takes effect on the date it is given to the religious leader or member or religious group, as the case may be.\nFinally, section 8(3) is amended to make it clear that a restraining order, which takes effect immediately once made, stays in force for a period specified in the order (the maximum length of which is unchanged at 2 years) unless the restraining order fails to be confirmed by the President. Under section 12(1), the\nPresident is provided 30 days upon receiving the PCRH's recommendations, to decide whether to confirm the restraining order on the advice of the Cabinet. The\nPresident's discretion to deviate from the Cabinet's advice is retained where the\nPCRH's recommendation differs from that of the Cabinet.\nClause 6 amends section 9, which deals with restraining orders against any person who is inciting, instigating or encouraging any religious group or religious institution or any religious leader or member against whom a restraining order can be made under section 8(1), to commit certain acts for which a restraining order may issue (called third parties).\nThe process for making a restraining order under section 9 against third parties is similarly amended as in section 8.\nLikewise, section 9(3) is amended to make it clear that a restraining order made under section 9(1), which takes effect immediately once made, stays in force for a period specified in the order (the maximum length of which is unchanged at\n2 years) unless the restraining order fails to be confirmed by the President. Under section 12(1), the President is provided 30 days upon receiving the PCRH's recommendations, to decide whether to confirm the restraining order on the advice of the Cabinet. The President's discretion to deviate from the Cabinet's advice is retained where the PCRH's recommendation differs from that of the Cabinet.\nClause 7 repeals section 10 of the Act because it is made redundant by the new process contained in the amendments in clause 5 to section 8 and in clause 8 to section 11. In its place is a new section 10 which makes clear that the expanded powers to make restraining orders, the issuance of a community remedial initiative and the competent authority's directions do not (except as provided in the new section 16F) affect any other written law which may apply to situations covered by the Act. For example, the Internal Security Act (Cap. 143) has powers to deal with insurgent activities and religious groups are often societies, which are also regulated under the Societies Act (Cap. 311).\nClause 8 amends section 11 to set out a new process of what happens after a restraining order made by the Minister under section 8(1) or (1A) or 9(1) (as amended) is referred to the PCRH.\nThe amendments provide that the Minister must, after making a restraining order under section 8(1) or (1A) or 9(1), immediately give or cause to be given, to the PCRH a copy of the order and the grounds, facts and documents supporting the order.\nThe person against whom the restraining order is made, and the head or governing body of the religious group or religious institution named in the restraining order, is entitled to make representations to the PCRH against the restraining order. The time delimited for representations to be made to the PCRH is 14 days after the restraining order is given to the person against whom the restraining order is made.\nAn amendment is made to section 11(2) to reflect the change in clauses 5 and 6, under which the Minister does not need to give a person an opportunity to make representations before the Minister makes a restraining order.\nSection 11 is also amended to allow the PCRH, if it considers it necessary for its deliberations, to invite any person to attend before the PCRH and be examined on the matter. The PCRH today is already allowed to call on the person against whom a restraining order is made to attend before the PCRH to be orally examined at its meeting.\nFinally, section 11(4) is amended so that the period the PCRH must arrive at a decision to recommend to the President is extended to 30 days after the time for\nmaking representations to the PCRH lapses, and not 30 days from the time the restraining order is given to the person against whom the restraining order is made.\nClause 9 amends section 12 by changing the cross-references in the provision as a consequence of the amendments in clauses 5 and 6. Under section 12(1), the\nPresident is still provided 30 days upon receiving the PCRH's recommendations, to decide whether to confirm a restraining order on the advice of the Cabinet. The\nPresident's discretion to deviate from the Cabinet's advice is retained where the\nPCRH's recommendation differs from that of the Cabinet.\nClause 10 amends section 13, which relates to the extension of restraining orders. Under sections 8(3) and 9(3), a restraining order is in force for a period specified in the order, which in no case can exceed 2 years.\nSection 13 is further amended to make clear that sections 11 and 12 apply to any direction to extend a restraining order as if a reference in those provisions to an order includes a reference to a direction to extend, but that the PCRH may recommend that a direction to extend be confirmed or cancelled only.\nClause 11 makes an amendment to section 14(2) to extend the power of the\nMinister to revoke restraining orders to include those made under sections 8 and 9 as well as those extended under section 13.\nClause 12 deletes section 16(2) because it is made redundant by the new section 17C introduced by clause 14. The other amendments are consequential upon the changes contained in clause 5.\nClause 13 inserts new Parts IVand V. Part IV sets out general countermeasures which apply to all religious groups to counter foreign influence over the affairs of religious groups. Part V contains provisions which are supplementary or in aid of the countermeasures in the rest of the Act.\nPart IV is made up of 5 new sections, namely sections 16A to 16E.\nThe new section 16A requires every reportable donation accepted by any religious group during each reporting period to be disclosed to a competent authority in a donation report which must accord with the requirements under the new section.\nA donation is treated as accepted by a religious group if it is received and retained by or on behalf of the religious group for its use or benefit; see the new section 2A(1) inserted by clause 3.\nA \"reportable donation\" is defined by amendments in clause 2 to mean a religious donation given by a relevant donor to and accepted by the religious group, which is of or exceeding $10,000 on any one occasion, without aggregating any earlier donation by the same relevant donor to the same religious group.\nA \"relevant donor\" is defined by the amendments in clause 2 to mean a person who makes a religious donation to the religious group and who, at the time the\ndonation is accepted by the religious group, is neither a citizen of Singapore nor a permanent resident of Singapore, and is not a resident which the regulations will prescribe to be permissible. The latter may be long-term dependent or work pass holders.\nWhere the donor is not an individual but an entity, the entity is a relevant donor if it is not registered in Singapore (even if incorporated outside Singapore), or is not incorporated, under any written law of Singapore, or is not a corporation sole or corporation aggregate established under a private Act for religious purposes.\nAn anonymous donation given to and accepted by the religious group, which is of or exceeding $10,000, is also a reportable donation.\nThe donation report is an annual document in respect of a reporting period, which is a period of 12 months corresponding to the calendar year. It has to be given to a competent authority no later than 1 April of the year following the year in which the reportable donation was accepted.\nThe information to be included in a donation report will be set out in regulations which the Minister is empowered to make under section 19. The information could include, in respect of each reportable donation, the identity of the donor (including his or her name, identity card number, address and nationality), the amount of the donation and the circumstances in which the donation was made.\nThe donation report of a religious group has to be signed by every responsible officer of the religious group and must be accompanied by a declaration made by every responsible officer of the religious group. Where a religious group accepts no religious donation which requires reporting, the responsible officers must still prepare a declaration to that effect.\nThe new section 16B imposes a requirement on religious groups to disclose foreign affiliations to a competent authority through an annual foreign affiliations report. Disclosure to a competent authority is required of every arrangement or agreement to which a religious group is party during a reporting period, being an arrangement or agreement which is with a foreign principal, and under which the religious group is accustomed, or under an obligation (whether formal or informal), to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of the foreign principal, or under which the foreign principal is in a position to exercise, in any other way, total or substantial control over the religious group's activities in\nSingapore.\nThe reporting period is a period of 12 months corresponding to the calendar year. A foreign affiliations report has to be given to a competent authority no later than 1 April of the year following the year to which the foreign affiliations report relates.\nThe information to be included in a foreign affiliations report will be set out in regulations which the Minister is empowered to make under section 19. A foreign\naffiliations report of a religious group has to be signed by every responsible officer of the religious group and must be accompanied by a declaration made by every responsible officer of the religious group.\nThe new section 16C imposes a requirement on religious groups to disclose the composition of its governing body in a key management report to a competent authority.\nThe disclosure required is about every individual who is a member of the governing body of any religious group on the day the new section 16C comes into force, or is or becomes (whether by appointment or election or otherwise) thereafter a member of the governing body of any religious group.\nA religious group is also required to give a competent authority a key management report whenever any individual, for any reason, stops acting as a member of the governing body of the religious group. The latter situation can arise due to resignation or death.\nIn addition, a religious group must give a competent authority information about its constitution, memorandum or articles of association, trust deed or equivalent instrument of the religious group as in effect on the day the new section 16C comes into force, and whenever there is a change thereafter to its constitution, memorandum or articles of association, trust deed or equivalent instrument, where that is a change affecting (directly or indirectly) the size or composition of its governing body.\nFor a key management report relating to appointments and the constitution, memorandum or articles of association, trust deed or equivalent instrument of the religious group as in effect on the day the new section 16C comes into force, the report must be given not later than 60 days after that day. In all other cases, the key management report has to be given within 30 days after the happening of the relevant event. The competent authority has the power to grant extensions on a case-by-case basis.\nThe information to be included in a key management report will be set out in regulations which the Minister is empowered to make under section 19. This will include details about the identity, nationality and other particulars of every such individual who is or becomes a member of the governing body of the religious group and of every responsible officer of the religious group, and details about changes to the constitution, memorandum or articles of association, trust deed or equivalent instrument of a religious group affecting the size or composition (or both) of its governing body.\nEvery key management report of a religious group has to be signed by every responsible officer of the religious group.\nThe new section 16D places a general requirement on all religious groups in\nSingapore prohibiting these religious groups from appointing (or re-appointing)\nan individual who is not a citizen of Singapore and not a Singapore permanent resident as a responsible officer of the religious group, or from permitting an individual who is not a citizen of Singapore and not a Singapore permanent resident to act as a responsible officer of the religious group, unless the religious group does so in accordance with the approval of the Minister.\nThe requirement in the new section 16D does not apply when the Bill's amendments first come into force. The prohibition in the new section 16D is triggered to apply only on or after a date the Minister will specify by an order in the Gazette. This is to give time for religious groups to prepare for this new requirement.\nOnce the Minister triggers the application of section 16D by order in the\nGazette, that order cannot be revoked. Any subsequent change to or lifting of the requirement in section 16D must be by way of an amendment to the Act or by way of an exemption under the new section 21.\nWhere a competent authority is satisfied that a religious group in Singapore has acted in contravention of the prohibition in the new section 16D, the competent authority is given power to direct the religious group to remove the responsible officer from his or her office or employment within the period specified in the notice, and the religious group must comply with that direction.\nA competent authority is not required to give any person notice of, or consult any person on, the competent authority's intention to direct a religious group to remove an individual from his or her office or employment.\nEven though the direction takes effect immediately and must be complied with once given, if a religious group which is directed, or the individual required to be removed in a direction, is aggrieved by the direction, the religious group or the individual (as the case may be) may appeal to the Minister. The appeal must, however, be made within 14 days after the competent authority's notice of the direction is given to the religious group or individual (as the case may be).\nIn the event that for any reason (such as by resignation, death or otherwise), a responsible officer of a religious group ceases to be either a citizen of Singapore or a Singapore permanent resident, the religious group has to give written notice of that event to the competent authority, within 30 days after the religious group first becomes aware of that event. This can include a situation of loss of Singapore citizenship or Singapore permanent resident status.\nThe new section 16E introduces a requirement for every religious group in\nSingapore to ensure that more than half of the total number of seats in its governing body are occupied or held by individuals who are citizens of Singapore unless the religious group is expressly allowed by the Minister to do otherwise.\nThe majority is defined in terms of the actual number of seats on the governing body and disregards vacancies.\nAs is the case for the new section 16D, the requirement in the new section 16E does not apply when the Bill's amendments first come into force. The prohibition in the new section 16E is triggered to apply only on or after a date the Minister will specify by an order in the Gazette. This is to give time for religious groups to prepare for this new requirement.\nOnce the Minister triggers the application of section 16E by order in the\nGazette, that order cannot be revoked. Any subsequent change to or lifting of the requirement in section 16E must be by way of an amendment to the Act or by way of an exemption under the new section 21.\nWhere a competent authority is satisfied that a religious group in Singapore has, without the Minister's approval, permitted half or more than half of the total number of seats in its governing body to be occupied or held by individuals who are not citizens of Singapore, the competent authority has power to direct the religious group to remove such number of members of the governing body who are not citizens of Singapore from their office within the period specified in the notice.\nA competent authority is not required to give any person notice of, or consult any person on, the competent authority's intention to direct a religious group to remove an individual from his or her office.\nEven though the direction takes effect immediately and must be complied with once given, if a religious group which is directed, or the individual required to be removed in a direction, is aggrieved by the direction, the religious group or the individual (as the case may be) may appeal to the Minister. The appeal must, however, be made within 14 days after the competent authority's notice of the direction is given to the religious group or individual (as the case may be).\nFinally, clause 13 inserts a new Part V, which is made up of 3 sections.\nThe new section 16F makes clear that a restraining order under the new section 8(1A) and the directions under the new section 16D(2) or (3) or 16E(2) or\n(3) have effect despite the provisions of any other written law in force and the constitution, memorandum or articles of association, trust deed or equivalent instrument of a religious group.\nAs there can be constitutions, trust deeds, etc., of religious groups which are inconsistent with a requirement in a restraining order under the new section 8(1A) or in a direction under the new section 16D(2) or (3) or 16E(2) or (3), or there are non-national incumbent office-holders of religious groups whose terms are current when the new section 16D or 16E is triggered, the new section 16F provides that no criminal or civil liability will be incurred by a religious group in Singapore, or any person acting on behalf of the religious group, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done with reasonable care and in good faith in the discharge or purported discharge of the obligations of the religious group under a requirement\nof the restraining order or the competent authority's direction under the new section 16D or 16E.\nThe new section 16G confers power on a competent authority to require by notice any religious group to provide, within a reasonable period specified in the notice, a document or all information or material (or both) for enforcement purposes, where the document, information or material are within the knowledge of that religious group or in the custody or under the control of the religious group.\nEnforcement purposes are to determine whether any information or material provided to a competent authority under a provision of the Act or its subsidiary legislation is correct and to determine whether there are grounds for any direction or restraining order to be given under the Act against a religious group.\nThe new section 16H deals with the community remedial initiative, which is aimed at more expeditiously and better addressing inter-religious tensions.\nA community remedial initiative is an agreement between the Minister and an alleged offender under which the alleged offender agrees to take one or more remedial actions, participate in one or more activities, or do any other thing, to promote religious harmony in Singapore. This may include issuing a public apology or taking part in community programmes at his or her expense.\nAn offer of a community remedial initiative may be made by the Minister to an alleged offender. An alleged offender is a person (whether or not a religious leader), who in the opinion of the Minister, is attempting to engage in conduct, is engaging or has engaged in conduct, or is likely to engage in conduct that causes, or the alleged offender knows is likely to incite, feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility against, or contempt for or ridicule of, a person or a group in\nSingapore, or conduct on the ground of religion or religious belief or activity and that the alleged offender knows is likely to insult the religion or religious belief or activity, or is likely to wound the religious feelings, of another person (as defined for the offences in the new sections 17E and 17F).\nA community remedial initiative is an agreement that may be entered into between the alleged offender and the Minister in lieu of prosecution for the alleged offence committed by that conduct. A person may choose whether to enter into a community remedial initiative with the Minister.\nUnder the new section 16H, the Minister is empowered to offer an alleged offender an opportunity to take one or more remedial actions, participate in one or more activities, or do any other thing, to promote religious harmony in Singapore.\nHowever, no offer can be made with respect to any conduct or attempt to engage in conduct occurring before the date of commencement of section 13 of the\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony (Amendment) Act 2019. The latter is necessary so as to observe the constitutional prohibition against retroactive criminal laws.\nIf the Minister believes that an alleged offender who entered into a community remedial initiative has failed to comply with the terms of that agreement, the\nMinister may terminate the community remedial initiative and refer the alleged offence to the Public Prosecutor. It is only while a community remedial initiative in respect of an alleged offence is in force that the alleged offender cannot be prosecuted for that alleged offence under the Act or any other written law in any criminal proceedings.\nClause 14 inserts new sections 17A to 17L pertaining to offences.\nThe new sections 17A and 17B are standard provisions for the liability of officers of offenders who are corporations or unincorporated bodies.\nThe new section 17A deals with corporate offenders and for attributing criminal liability to officers of corporate entities for offences committed by their entities.\nCorporations like companies can be held directly liable for the conduct and can be found guilty of, and punished for, the commission of an offence. As a separate legal entity, liability for the offence is imposed on the corporation itself and is not generally attributed to its officers and employees unless there is a provision like the section. This standard provision in many laws has been redrafted here to be consistent with the modern Singapore drafting style to make it easier to read and understand.\nThe new section 17B deals with unincorporated entities like partnerships and associations and for attributing criminal liability to officers of unincorporated entities for offences committed by their bodies. The section also provides clarity where the offence by the unincorporated entity requires a mental element and is not a strict liability offence.\nThe new section 17C confers jurisdiction on a District Court to try any offence under the Bill and to impose the full punishment for any such offence.\nThe new section 17D provides powers of composition that may be exercised by a competent authority.\nAn offence which is prescribed by regulations as a compoundable offence may be compounded by collecting from a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum not exceeding one half of the amount of the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence or $5,000, whichever is lower.\nThe new sections 17E, 17F and 17G set out the more serious offences and the interpretative provisions relating to these matters. The sections do not criminalise religious hatred per se but defines the limits of acceptable behaviour so as to constitute an offence.\nThe new section 17E covers offences which involve knowingly urging the use of force or violence on religious grounds or against target groups or target persons in Singapore.\nThe offence in the new section 17E(1) and (2) deals with the offence of knowingly urging, on the ground of religion or religious belief or activity, the use of force or violence, and the target group or target person is distinguished by religion or religious belief or activity, or by ethnicity, descent, nationality, language or political opinion, or any other characteristic whether or not of a similar kind.\nThe target group need not be confined to persons who practise a certain religion.\nThe target group may be made up of atheists, individuals from a specific racial community, who share a similar sexual orientation, or have a certain nationality or descent like foreign workers or new citizens.\nFor the offences under the new section 17E(1) or (2), so long as the use of force or violence is urged, there is no need to be concerned whether that would threaten the public peace or public order in Singapore or any part of Singapore.\nThe new section 17E(3) and (4) sets out offences which involve knowingly engaging in conduct urging another person, or a group of persons, to use force or violence against a target person or target group in Singapore knowing that force or violence is likely to occur. The conduct is not engaged in on the ground of religion or religious belief or activity, but the target group is distinguished only by religion or religious belief or activity (as defined).\nWhat is \"religious belief or activity\" is defined to mean holding a religious belief or view or engaging in religious activity. The definition does not extend to cover atheists or persons who lack any religious belief or view.\nThe punishment for every offence under the new section 17E is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or a fine, or both.\nThe new section 17F(1) and (2) makes it an offence if a person who is a religious leader knowingly engages in conduct that incites feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility against, or contempt for or ridicule of, a group (a target group), or that insults the religion or religious belief or activity, or wounds the religious feelings, of another person (a target person), being a target group or target person distinguished by religion or religious belief or activity, and the religious leader does so knowing that feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility against, or contempt for or ridicule of, the target group is likely to occur or that the religion or religious belief or activity of the target person is likely to be insulted or the religious feelings of the target person are likely to be wounded.\nA separate but similar offence is provided for under section 17F(3) and (4) where the person doing the same acts above is not a religious leader, and the feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility against, or contempt for or ridicule of, a target group or target person, and the insult or wounding (as the case may be), would threaten the public peace or public order in Singapore or any part of\nSingapore.\nIn the new section 17F, \"religious belief or activity\" is defined similarly as in the new section 17E.\nAn exception is where a person points out in good faith any matters that are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different religious groups, or are insulting the religion or religious belief or activity or wounding the religious feelings of a person or persons distinguished by religion or religious belief or activity, in order to bring about a removal of those matters.\nThe offence under section 17F(3) or (4) does not extend to private conduct. That is, it is a defence if the conduct is one intended to be heard or seen only by themselves but not conduct in circumstances in which the parties to the conduct ought reasonably to expect that it may be heard or seen by someone else.\nHowever, the defence for the offence under the new section 17F(1) or (2) involving religious leaders is narrower. Only domestic communications (such as between the accused and relatives or members of his or her household) and intended to be heard or seen only by themselves, but not in circumstances in which the parties to the communication ought reasonably to expect that it may be heard or seen by someone else, will lie outside the offence under the new section 17F(1) or (2). For example, a private conversation between a religious leader and his or her children in the presence of the domestic worker living in the same household.\nAnother example would be a private discussion between the religious leader and friends taking place within the residence of the religious leader (which may be a common lodging like a monastery) in conditions not reasonably intended for others to see or hear.\nThe punishment for all offences under the new section 17F is the same. That is, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or a fine, or both.\nThe new section 17G is an interpretative provision for the purposes of the new offences in the new sections 17E and 17F.\nThe new sections 17H to 17L contain lesser offences relating to the countermeasures against foreign influence.\nThe new section 17H provides for the offence of a religious group not giving to a competent authority a donation report, foreign affiliations report or key management report which is required under Part IV in respect of a religious group or any declaration relating to any such report which is required under Part IV in respect of a religious group, in accordance with the requirements of that Part. If this happens, every responsible officer of the religious group is guilty of an offence and is each liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $200 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.\nThere is also another strict liability offence where in a donation report, foreign affiliations report or key management report, or a declaration relating to such a report, which is required to be given under Part IV in respect of a religious group, there is a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular, or an omission of any matter or thing without which the donation report or declaration is misleading in a material particular, and the report or declaration is given to a competent authority. Every responsible officer of the religious group is guilty of an offence and is each liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.\nBut where a responsible officer of a religious group, with an intent to deceive, makes in a donation report, foreign affiliations report or key management report which is required to be given under Part IV in respect of the religious group a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular or an omission of any matter or thing without which the report is misleading in a material particular, or a false declaration required to be given under Part IV in respect of a donation report, foreign affiliations report or key management report of the religious group, the responsible officer is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $20,000.\nThe new section 17I sets out offences aimed generally at persons other than the responsible officers of a religious group or the group itself. The new section 17I(1) makes it an offence for a person who, with intent to deceive, withholds from a religious group any material information relating to the identity of a donor of a religious donation or the amount of a religious donation to the religious group, or intentionally or knowingly gives, in relation to the identity of a donor of a religious donation or the amount of a religious donation to a religious group, information to the religious group which is false or misleading in a material particular.\nThe new section 17I(2) provides for an offence where a person enters into or knowingly does any act in furtherance of any arrangement which facilitates or is likely to facilitate, whether by means of any concealment or disguise or otherwise, the making of a donation to a religious group by a person prohibited by a restraining order under the new section 8(1A).\nThe punishment is a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $20,000.\nThe new section 17J concerns a religious group failing to give notice to a competent authority within the time required by the new section 16D(8) and permitting an individual who is not a citizen of Singapore and not a Singapore permanent resident to act as a responsible officer of the religious group in contravention of section 16D(2).\nThere is also an offence if a religious group fails to give notice to a competent authority within the time required by the new section 16E(8) and the religious group permits half or more than half of the total number of seats in its governing\nbody to be occupied or held by individuals who are not citizens of Singapore in contravention of section 16E(2).\nThe punishment is a fine not exceeding $5,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding $500 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.\nThe new section 17K sets out the offence of giving information or material or producing a document to a competent authority knowing that the information or material or the document is false or misleading in a material particular or the information or material omits any matter or thing without which the information or material is misleading in a material particular.\nThe punishment is a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $20,000.\nThe new section 17L makes it an offence if the person who is required by a notice given to the person under section 16G to provide a document or information or material to a competent authority does not do so. The offence is a strict liability offence.\nIt is also not a defence for a person to refuse or fail to provide any document or any information or material if doing so might tend to incriminate that person.\nHowever, the new section 17L acknowledges that the coercive information- gathering power should be accompanied by an appropriate protection for the informant. It provides that where a person claims, before producing any document or giving any information or material that the person is required by section 16G to produce or give, that the production of the document or the giving of the information or material might tend to incriminate him or her, that document or information or material, the fact of the production of the document or the provision of the information or material, or any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or an indirect consequence of the production of the document or giving of the information or material, is not admissible in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings. However, the protection will not apply in proceedings for an offence under the Act or any written law in respect of the falsity of the document or the information or material.\nClause 15 amends section 19 which relates to regulation making. The power of the Minister to make regulations is expanded to deal with the new areas covered by the amendments in the preceding clauses.\nThe regulation-making powers in section 19 are extended to cover requiring the making, keeping and auditing of records of religious donations and anonymous donations received and accepted by religious groups, and requiring and otherwise providing for the production, examination and copying of those records.\nRegulations may also require the making and keeping of records of affiliations, and the responsible officers and governing bodies of religious groups, and\nrequiring and otherwise providing for the production, examination and copying of those records.\nIn addition, the Minister may make regulations to deal with the procedure by which the PCRH is to follow when it receives representations and when it makes recommendations to the President.\nClause 16 introduces 2 new sections, namely sections 20 and 21.\nThe new section 20 provides for the service of documents permitted or required to be served under the Act as amended by the Bill, but not documents required for proceedings in court. The latter fall within the purview of the Rules Committee under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322).\nThe new section 20 provides for a range of methods for serving documents, with modes of service that follow the technological advances in communications.\nIn addition to service by fax, service by email is also permissible at the last email address given by the addressee concerned to the person giving or serving the document as the email address for the service of documents under the Act.\nService is also permitted by giving an electronic notice to the individual, partnership, body corporate or unincorporated association (called an addressee) by the addressee's chosen means of notification, stating that the document is available and how the addressee may use the addressee's chosen means of access to access the document's contents. For example, a recipient of a notice may choose to be notified by a mobile phone application that notifies the person that a notice to the person is available to be accessed on a website maintained by a competent authority.\nHowever, service of any document on a person by email or by an electronic notice at the person's chosen means of notification may be effected only with the person's prior consent to service in that way. The consent may be given expressly or impliedly. An instance of implied consent may be by not opting out within the allowed time, such as when the sender informs the recipient of the intention to serve all notices using an electronic mode unless the recipient notifies the sender that the recipient does not agree to accepting service in that way.\nFinally, there is also facility for service by any other method authorised by regulations for the service of documents of that kind if the addressee consents (expressly or impliedly) to service of a document of that kind in that way.\nThe new section 20 also provides for special service arrangements for a person where by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the name of the addressee to whom the document is to be served cannot be ascertained. The provision allows the document to be served by electronic communication to an Internet location address or a website associated with that addressee, or to an account on social media associated with that addressee, if the account provides a mechanism for that addressee to receive electronic communications in that account.\nThe new section 21 confers an exemption power on the Minister to disapply any provision in the new Part IVor the regulations made for the purposes of that Part to any person. This has to be done by way of an order in the Gazette.\nClause 17 contains related amendments to the Penal Code. The first batch of amendments is to section 74 of the Penal Code to provide for enhancement of punishment for racially or religiously aggravated offences, from one and a half times to 2 times the amount of punishment to which an accused would otherwise have been liable for that offence. The list of offences which may attract the enhanced punishment is no longer a closed list in section 74 but any offence under the Penal Code except for sections 298 and 298A, and an offence which is punishable with death or imprisonment for life.\nThis is because clause 17 also amends sections 298 and 298A of the Penal Code to remove the religious elements in those offences. Sections 295, 296 and 297 of the Penal Code are also repealed since the new sections 17E and 17F introduced by clause 14 incorporate many of their elements.\nClause 18 contains consequential amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Registration of Criminals\nAct.\nClause 19 is a saving and transitional provision which preserves the Act as in force before the amendments in clauses 5, 6, 8 and 9 come into force, in relation to restraining orders made before the amendments come into force.\nClause 19 further empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing such additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of any provision in the Bill, as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient. The Minister has power to do so only within 2 years after the date of commencement of the provision.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The new section 15A relates to the power to require information relating to private parking places and the new section 15B relates to the power of entry into private parking places for survey or inspection.\nClause 6 contains transitional provisions.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 2(4) of the Town Councils Act 1988 is amended by inserting, immediately after the words \"under section\", the words \"33 or\".\nSaving and transitional provisions\n48. For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any provision of this Act, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that provision as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 primarily for the following purposes:\n(a) to provide for special voting arrangements for electors who are in-patients or residents of nursing homes;\n(b) to allow for postal voting to be undertaken by overseas electors;\n(c) to reform the law on election advertising;\n(d) to allow for greater use of technology to ensure more efficient voter registration and election processes;\n(e) to provide more flexibility in addressing disruptive events affecting elections.\nThe Bill also makes consequential and related amendments to the Foreign\nInterference (Countermeasures) Act 2021 and the Town Councils Act 1988.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 by replacing definitions or setting out new definitions because of the amendments in the Bill.\nIn particular, there is an extended meaning of \"publish\" which would apply to provisions which use that expression and are not directly amended by the Bill, such as section 78D regarding exit polls on polling day.\nClause 3 amends section 5(1A) by simplifying the criteria by which a non-resident citizen of Singapore is deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore and be qualified to be on a register of electors.\nThe requirement that the individual must be, on the prescribed date in a year, have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of 30 days during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the prescribed date, is replaced by keeping and maintaining a contact address under section 10(2) of the National Registration\nAct 1965 on that prescribed date. The prescribed date means the cut-off date for qualifying to be on the register of electors.\nThe amendments in clause 3 are connected with those in clause 6 relating to the registration of overseas electors.\nClause 4 amends section 8 concerning electoral divisions. The amendment will allow the boundaries of electoral divisions to be described in more than one way.\nThe present method of describing electoral divisions in the Gazette in prose, specifying their boundaries by metres, bounds and coordinates is retained. The amendment introduces another method, which is by one or more maps or images in the Gazette, containing details and markings that delineate the boundaries of each electoral division.\nTo ensure accessibility of the information about electoral division boundaries where one or more maps or images are published in the Gazette, the Registration\nOfficer is required by the amendments to \u2014\n(a) prepare and certify further maps on a scale larger than the published map or maps;\n(b) make the further maps available for free inspection by any member of the public at a reasonable hour on any day, and for sale at a reasonable cost; and\n(c) establish and maintain a website at which the maps or images of the electoral division may be accessed free of charge online 24/7.\nThe Registration Officer has to publish in the same notification in the Gazette, a notice containing particulars of the website at which the maps or images of the electoral division may be accessed free of charge online, and the place at which the further maps or other images may be inspected, by the public.\nClause 5 amends section 11, which deals with claims and objections to entries in a register of electors prepared for any electoral division. Section 11(9B) is amended to allow the Registration Officer to reject a claim to be entitled to be included in a register, without first holding any public inquiry, if the claim is frivolous or vexatious. For example, the claim may contain no difference in the claimant's particulars in the registers.\nClause 6 amends section 13A, which concerns registration of overseas electors.\nThe amendments in this clause relate to those in clause 3.\nThe first change is to the criteria for a citizen entered in a register of electors for an electoral division to be registered as an overseas elector.\nTo be qualified to be registered as an overseas elector, the registered elector has to be resident in Singapore for an aggregate of 30 days during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the date the person applies to the Registration Officer to be registered as an overseas elector. This is a relaxation from the present criteria, which is an aggregate of 30 days during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the cut-off date for qualifying to be on the register of electors. This will give more time for non-resident electors to register as overseas electors.\nThe next change is expanding how an overseas elector can cast his or her vote.\nThe amendments provide 2 voting facilities for a citizen who is registered as an overseas elector, and he or she is given a choice as to which facility he or she wants to use to cast his or her vote in a parliamentary election or presidential election.\nA citizen who is registered as an overseas elector may apply to cast his or her vote either in person at an overseas polling station or by the postal voting method prescribed under the Act as amended by the Bill. The options are mutually\nexclusive; he or she cannot choose postal voting in addition to voting in person at an overseas polling station.\nIf the registered overseas elector opts to vote in an election in person at an overseas polling station, he or she can vote in person at the overseas polling station or in person at a polling station in Singapore. This present situation is not changed by the amendments in the Bill.\nIf the registered overseas elector opts to vote in an election via postal voting, he or she can cast the vote and have it mailed or sent back to the Returning Officer for counting or vote in person at a polling station in Singapore.\nThe option as to which voting facility a registered overseas elector wants to use may be changed at any time before the third day after the issue of the writ of election for a parliamentary election or presidential election.\nThe third change is to minimise accidental disenfranchisement among overseas electors by relieving them from having to re-apply to retain that status each time the certified register of electors is superseded. The amendments provide for the continuation of the registration of any person as an overseas elector unless the person applies to cancel the person's registration as an overseas elector and the\nRegistration Officer cancels accordingly, or the person's name is expunged or removed from the register of electors.\nThere is also one other situation where a person's registration as an overseas elector ends. This can occur when the registers of electors are prepared under section 10(1) or (1A) or revised under section 14 for any year. Where the\nRegistration Officer, after proper inquiry, is satisfied that the person has not resided in Singapore for an aggregate of 30 days during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the prescribed date of that year, the Registration Officer may cancel the overseas elector registration.\nWhere a person's registration as an overseas elector is so cancelled by the\nRegistration Officer, the Registration Officer has power to restore the person's registration upon an application by the person to the Registration Officer for a reconsideration of the cancellation.\nHowever, this also does not prevent the affected elector making an application to re-register as an overseas elector to vote at the next election. He or she can return to Singapore more frequently and show that he or she has been resident in\nSingapore for an aggregate of 30 days during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the date the person applies to the Registration Officer to be re-registered as an overseas elector, in order to be re-registered.\nFinally, clause 6 amends section 13A to deem any overseas elector whose name is entered in the certified register of electors in operation for an electoral division as registered as an overseas elector for that electoral division.\nClause 7 amends section 15(2) on where a revised register of electors may be open for inspection. The public notice that the Registration Officer has to give upon the completion of the revised register of electors will state that the revised register may be inspected at the same places that completed registers and claims and objections may be inspected.\nThis is in addition to the present means, which is in-person inspection at the office of the Registration Officer or at any other place or places in or outside\nSingapore as may be specified in the notice.\nClause 8 amends section 20 to align where certified registers of electors may be inspected with the amendments in clause 7.\nThe amendment allows for the certified registers to be open for inspection at any other place or places in or outside Singapore as may be specified in the notice as well as in any other manner as may be specified in the public notice that the\nRegistration Officer is required to give once a register of electors is certified.\nClause 9 amends section 27(2), which relates to nomination papers for an election in a single member constituency. The amendment is to make clear that the nomination paper of a candidate must set out his or her full name, as indicated on the candidate's identity card.\nClause 10 makes a similar amendment to section 27B(2), which relates to nomination papers for an election in a group representation constituency.\nClause 11 amends section 28, which concerns election deposits. The amendment allows for an earlier return of the election deposit to successfully returned candidates.\nSection 28(4) is deleted and substituted to enable the return of the election deposit in all cases after the results of the election in the electoral division concerned are published in the Gazette under section 33 (if the election is uncontested) or section 51 (if the election is contested). There is no longer a need for a successfully returned candidate to wait till the new Parliament is convened when he or she takes his or her oath of office as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the election deposit to be refunded.\nClause 12 amends section 34 to require the notice of contested election in a single member constituency to also state the day and hours of the poll at every special polling station established under the new section 47A.\nClause 13 makes a similar amendment to section 34A(6) in relation to the notice of contested election for a group representation constituency.\nClause 14 amends section 36A, which concerns the setting up of polling stations.\nThe amendment will allow the Returning Officer to establish an ordinary polling station outside an electoral division (called electoral division X) in another\nelectoral division that has a common boundary with electoral division X, for the conduct of the poll for electoral division X. However, the Returning Officer can do so only if he or she is satisfied that doing so is conducive to the convenience of a large number of electors residing near the common boundary.\nClause 14 also amends section 36A to enable better crowd control at ordinary polling stations and special polling stations, which are located within land that has a boundary fence or another structure or feature to mark the boundary of the land (defined to mean \"grounds\" in clause 2). These are usually larger polling stations found within schools.\nUnder the amendment, the Returning Officer is empowered to designate an entrance to those grounds as a designated entrance to the polling station and the routes that electors have to use to access the polling places within the polling station and the polling booths. An official sign has to be erected or set up to indicate the designated entrance to those grounds.\nThe designating of entrances for these usually larger polling stations will facilitate a more definitive restricted signage zone and restricted zone under the new section 61J on traditional election advertising, and the amended section 82 on preventing undue influence on polling day at and near a polling station (see clause 41).\nClause 15 amends section 39, which concerns admittance into polling stations, mainly to address the 3 categories of polling stations under the Act as amended by the Bill. These are ordinary polling stations and special polling stations in\nSingapore, and overseas polling stations outside Singapore.\nA person must not be admitted to an ordinary polling station to vote in person at an election unless the person is allotted under section 36A(1)(c) to that ordinary polling station.\nAn overseas elector must not be admitted to an overseas polling station to vote in person at an election in any electoral division unless the person is registered as an overseas elector for that electoral division, is not designated under section 13A(3A) as a postal voter for that election and is allotted under section 13A(3A) to that overseas polling station.\nFinally, a person must not be admitted to a special polling station to vote in person at an election unless the person is allotted under section 47B(1) to that special polling station.\nThe other amendment in clause 15 is to section 39(3), which is consequential to the repeal of sections 56C and 56DA by clause 28.\nClause 16 repeals section 39A, which deals with voting at overseas polling stations, as the provisions on facilities exclusive to overseas electors are relocated to the new sections 56A to 56F.\nClause 17 amends section 42(5) by replacing the old-fashioned reference to a person being \"incapacitated\" due to blindness or other physical cause with the person being blind or having a physical disability.\nDue to the introduction of special polling arrangements for voters at nursing homes and postal voting by overseas electors, clause 18 amends section 43 (on compulsory voting) to provide for when an elector in these new voting conditions is to be treated as having recorded his or her vote and therefore will not be expunged from the registers of electors. If the elector's name is expunged, the elector has to pay for his or her name to be restored in the absence of a reasonable excuse.\nFirst, an elector who is allotted to a special polling station under the new section 47B(1) for the purposes of the poll in an electoral division and who attends in person at a polling place in the special polling station to vote or has his or her vote taken by a mobile polling team deployed at the special polling station, must be treated under section 43 as having recorded his or her vote at the election in the electoral division for which he or she is registered.\nSecond, where an overseas elector who is designated as a postal voter applies for postal voting papers to be issued to him or her during the postal voting period for an election, he or she is to be treated as having recorded his or her vote at the election in the electoral division for which he or she is registered. It does not matter whether his or her postal voting papers reached Singapore or were received by the Returning Officer on time for counting or whether the elector posted or sent his or her postal voting papers back to the Returning Officer.\nTreating an application for postal voting papers as if casting a vote is confined to the purpose of section 43, which is whether or not to expunge a name from the register of electors, and does not extend to other provisions in the Act, like the offence of personation in section 57.\nClause 19 introduces new sections 47A, 47B and 47C which enable the provision of special polling arrangements by the Returning Officer to service the voting needs of the in-patients or residents of nursing homes.\nThe new section 47A empowers the Returning Officer to establish all or part of a nursing home as a special polling station, and to authorise special polling arrangements to be provided to enable electors who are in-patients or residents of the nursing home during the election period to cast their votes there.\nThe special polling arrangements can be in either form as follows:\n(a) by establishing polling places within the special polling station as the\nReturning Officer considers necessary, so that the resident does not need to leave the nursing home and travel to his or her ordinary polling station to vote but can cast his or her vote in person at one of those polling places;\n(b) by deploying one or more mobile polling teams to visit in-patients or residents of the nursing home to take the votes of those in-patients or residents.\nThese special arrangements are to meet the voting needs of this class of electors and are not provided as a matter of course. The new section 47A sets out factors which the Returning Officer has to take into account before providing for special polling arrangements.\nIf the person in charge of a nursing home where a special polling station is established informs a presiding officer who is a member of a mobile polling team deployed at that special polling station that a visit to an in-patient or a resident is forbidden on medical grounds, the mobile polling team must not visit the in-patient or resident to take the in-patient's or resident's vote.\nA poll and voting in an election involving electors residing in a nursing home where a special polling station is established must be conducted, as far as practicable, in the same manner as that in which a poll and voting at an ordinary polling station is conducted under the Act.\nThe new section 47B provides that voting at a special polling station is in lieu of voting at an ordinary polling station.\nThe new section 47C empowers the Minister to make regulations to modify the application of any provision of the Act to the conduct of polls in any special polling station established in a nursing home.\nThis may include regulations that set out the manner of voting at the special polling station, including the taking of votes by mobile polling teams and fixing the maximum number of polling agents who may be admitted to a special polling station.\nGiven the surrounding environment of a special polling station and the distinct class of electors it will serve, the regulations may also provide for the admission of any person who is employed by the nursing home (whether or not a citizen of\nSingapore) into any polling place in the special polling station or authorising the presence of such an employee, for the purpose of providing any assistance to the presiding officers, mobile polling team or any elector at the special polling station.\nClause 20 amends section 48A on the procedure on closing of a poll. The amendment removes the requirement for the Returning Officer to direct the time for counting the votes at a specified counting place, and for aggregating the votes at a principal counting place if there is more than one specified counting place.\nThe counting of votes at a counting place will start upon receipt of all the ballot boxes containing the votes that are to be counted at that counting place. The aggregation of the votes at a principal counting place will also start upon receipt of all the results of the votes that are counted at each counting place. There is no need to wait for an hour specified before starting.\nClause 21 amends section 49 (on counting of votes) to enable the use of counting machines as part of the counting process, and to remove the requirement for the Returning Officer to keep the ballot papers with their faces upwards while counting the votes.\nThe amendment provides that votes cast may be counted manually, or by mechanical or electronic means.\nWhile the amendment removes the requirement to keep the ballot papers with their faces upwards while counting the votes, the amendment imposes a duty on the Returning Officer to take all proper precautions to ensure voter secrecy.\nClause 22 repeals section 49A (on counting of votes by overseas electors) which is consequential to amendments in clause 28.\nClause 23 amends section 49B (on recounting of votes by overseas electors) which is consequential to amendments in clause 28.\nClauses 24 and 25 amend sections 51 and 52 which are consequential to amendments in clause 28.\nClause 26 amends the offences in section 55 to deal with postal voting. The present offences already deal with improper handling of ballot papers, which will extend to include postal ballot papers by definition.\nThe amendments make it an offence to forge or counterfeit, or fraudulently deface or destroy any return envelope, which is defined by the amendments in clause 2 to be the envelope designed and intended to be used exclusively to contain a postal ballot paper.\nThe offences in section 55(1)(c), (d) and (e) are also extended to apply to the return envelope. For example, supplying any return envelope without due authority to any person, selling or offering to sell any return envelope or buying or offering to buy any return envelope, or unauthorised possession of a return envelope which has been marked with the official mark.\nNew offences of putting into any return envelope anything other than the postal ballot paper, which is authorised by law to put in, and intentionally opening, unsealing, damaging or tampering with a sealed return envelope without due authority are also created by clause 26.\nAs the conduct that constitutes the offence is likely to take place outside\nSingapore, section 55 is amended to extend to any citizen of Singapore (whether or not a voter or an elector) who engages in any conduct that constitutes an offence described, either outside Singapore or partly in Singapore. This is consistent with the present section 39A(5).\nClause 27 makes a consequential amendment to section 56 (on maintenance of secrecy at elections) arising from regulations which may be made under the new section 47C providing for the admission of any person who is employed by the\nnursing home (whether or not a citizen of Singapore) into any polling place in the special polling station or authorising the presence of such an employee, for the purpose of providing any assistance to the presiding officers, mobile polling team or any elector at the special polling station.\nClause 28 repeals the provisions which deal with disruptive events affecting election proceedings and replaces that with new sections 56A to 56G relating to voting by overseas electors and the introduction of postal voting for overseas electors.\nThe new section 56A covers overseas electors who are not designated as postal voters. Such an overseas elector has a choice to vote in person at an overseas polling station or in Singapore at an ordinary polling station.\nThe new section 56B deals with overseas electors who are designated as postal voters. A postal voter has a choice to cast his or her vote using the postal voting method or attend in person in Singapore at an ordinary polling station.\nThe new section 56B(3) describes how an overseas elector who is a designated postal voter is to cast a vote by the postal voting method. All the following steps in the sequence below must be taken by such an overseas elector before the end of the postal voting period:\n(a) apply to the Returning Officer, once the postal voting period of that election starts, for postal voting papers to be issued to the overseas elector. The application has to be done in the manner prescribed by regulations made under the new section 56F;\n(b) mark the overseas elector's vote on the postal ballot paper comprised in the postal voting papers issued on application, fold the postal ballot paper and insert it in the return envelope comprised in the postal voting papers so issued, and then seal the return envelope. This has to be done in the manner prescribed by regulations made under the new section 56F;\n(c) take the steps prescribed by those regulations with respect to those postal voting papers in order to indicate the date of posting or sending;\n(d) as soon as practicable after the return envelope is sealed, the overseas elector must himself or herself post or deliver the sealed return envelope to the Returning Officer in Singapore. Alternatively, the overseas elector may entrust the sealed return envelope to a person for posting or delivery to the Returning Officer in Singapore.\nThe period for postal voting for an election in an electoral division starts on the day immediately after the day of nomination at the election, and ends on (and includes) the eve of polling day in Singapore at that election. See the definition inserted by clause 2.\nThe new section 56C sets out a stage unique for votes cast by the postal voting method. This stage takes place just before counting of postal ballot papers starts.\nThe stage involves an examination of return envelopes. The Returning Officer has to accept for counting all return envelopes received before the end of the 10th day after polling day in Singapore unless he or she is not satisfied the return envelope is authentic, was received on time or is not opened or tampered with.\nThe new section 56C also deals with the situation where a return envelope may contain several ballot papers and where multiple return envelopes from the same designated postal voter are received.\nThe new section 56D deals with the counting of votes cast by overseas electors at overseas polling stations or via the postal voting method.\nThe new section 56E re-enacts the repealed section 49A on ascertaining the final election results after the votes of overseas electors have been counted.\nThe new section 56F empowers the Minister to make regulations modifying the application of any provision of the Act to the conduct of polls in overseas polling stations, and to provide procedural details as to the postal voting method.\nThe new section 56G creates a new offence for a person to whom an envelope containing or purporting to contain a postal ballot paper is given by an overseas elector for the purpose of delivery or sending to the Returning Officer, and who had agreed to deliver or send the envelope, if the person, without reasonable excuse, fails to deliver or send the envelope promptly.\nClause 29 amends section 61, which sets out the offence of a corrupt practice, primarily due to the amendments in clause 30 on election advertising.\nThe corrupt practice of contravening the published-by requirements in the present section 61(1)(c) is deleted as it is re-enacted in a more comprehensive form by clause 30 as the new section 61C. Section 61(5) and (6) is also deleted for the same reason.\nTo support the right to protection against unlawful attacks on reputation but without criminalising dissemination of falsehoods unknown to the sender and accidental dissemination, the corrupt practices in section 61(1)(d) and (e) are amended to introduce the mental element of knowingly making or publishing in\nSingapore, before or during an election period, a false statement about the personal conduct or character of a candidate or a false statement of the withdrawal of a candidate, for the purpose of affecting election results.\nFinally, the corrupt practice in section 61(1)(f) relating to returns of election expenses is also extended to cover corrected returns, because of the amendment in clause 35.\nClause 30 amends Part 3 by inserting 4 new Divisions which reform the law relating to election advertising so as to better support free and informed voting at\nelections which is essential to Singapore's system of representative government and to apply the new requirements to modern communication activities.\nThe election advertising covered can be online election advertising, non-online election advertising that is not traditional election advertising, and traditional election advertising.\n\"Online election advertising\" is defined in the amendments in clause 2 to mean election advertising that is published in any way that renders the election advertising accessible from the Internet.\n\"Non-online election advertising\" is also defined in the amendments in clause 2 to mean election advertising that is not online election advertising. Examples of election advertising that may be covered by this definition include election advertising by way of SMS, MMS, telephone calls, clothing, films that are not party political films, advertising painted on or shown on top of a private car or a drone, and a drone formation against the night sky.\nThe last class of election advertising covered is a sub-group of non-online election advertising, called \"traditional election advertising\". Clause 2 amends section 2 to define this as consisting of election advertising in the form of \u2014\n(a) a banner, flag or poster;\n(b) a billboard, sky sign, hoarding, signboard, digital display panel or free-standing advertising structure;\n(c) any text, colour or image (moving or still) which is projected on to any external surface of a building or structure by light or any other means; or\n(d) a blimp, a gas-inflated balloon or other like object which is attached or anchored to the ground and upon which information or material is displayed.\nThe controls in the 4 new Divisions inserted by clause 30 cover election advertising which is published in Singapore or is publicly displayed in Singapore.\nAs the Internet is borderless, the new Divisions inserted by clause 30 have extra-territorial application if the subject matter is online election advertising.\nClause 2 amends section 2 to provide that where any content is published by electronic means, the content is to be taken to be published in Singapore if \u2014\n(a) any person physically present in Singapore accesses or can have access to the content, even if the content originates wholly outside Singapore or is published by a person outside Singapore or the origin of which cannot be determined; or\n(b) the content originates in Singapore, even if none of the persons capable of having access to the content is physically present in Singapore.\nIt therefore does not matter if the act of publishing is done outside Singapore. So long as the content published on the Internet can be encountered, read, viewed, heard or otherwise experienced by a person physically present in Singapore, the content on the Internet will be treated as published in Singapore.\nClause 2 further amends section 2 to address the technological challenges to the application of the provisions in the Act, especially in connection with election advertising.\nFirst, clause 2 contains a new section 2(5) to deal with hyperlinks and\nQR codes. Any content consisting of or including a hyperlink is taken to include the content accessed directly via the hyperlink. Any content consisting of or including an item or image on which data is stored electronically is taken to include content accessed by means of the item or image.\nNext, a new section 2(6)(b) makes clear that for content that is published by electronic means, the word \"publish\" includes the act of posting or forwarding to, or sharing with, other end-users of an electronic service the content on or by the electronic service.\nClause 2 also introduces an extended meaning of \"publish\" for content that is published by electronic means and accessible from the Internet. The new section 2(6) extends \"publish\" to include taking any step to amplify the access to earlier published content by persons physically present in Singapore. For example, by boosting the search engine results for the earlier posted content.\nThe amendments in clause 2 also make clear that for any non-online election advertising, and any other election advertising that is not published by electronic means, the election advertising is taken to be published in Singapore if it is left in such a position and in such circumstances as to indicate that it is intended to be available for collection by members of the public who are in a public place.\nThe new Division 1 contains 5 new sections.\nThe new section 61A articulates the purpose for the various controls on election advertising. They are to promote free and informed voting at elections by enhancing \u2014\n(a) the transparency of the electoral system, by allowing voters to know who is communicating election advertising;\n(b) the accountability of those persons participating in public debate relating to any election, by making those persons responsible for their communications; and\n(c) the traceability of communications of election advertising, by ensuring that obligations imposed by the new Divisions 1, 2, 3 and 4 in relation to those communications can be enforced.\nThe new sections 61B, 61C, 61D and 61E apply regardless if the person is a candidate, a candidate's election agent, a political party, or is none of the preceding (called a \"third party\").\nThe election advertising covered is one that relates to the election in question.\nClause 2 introduces an interpretive provision which states that an election advertising relates to an election if it contains an express or implicit reference to \u2014\n(a) the election in the electoral division;\n(b) an individual who is a candidate at the election in the electoral division in his or her capacity as a candidate (and not in some other capacity, like as a Town Councillor or political office holder);\n(c) a political party, or the interests of a political party, with one or more candidates at the election in the electoral division; or\n(d) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in the election.\nAny other content which does not contain any of the above will not be restricted under the new sections 61B and 61C.\nThe new section 61B re-enacts the requirements presently found in section 61(1)(c) that election advertising must bear information about its publisher. Contravention of any of the requirements will be a corrupt practice which is a criminal offence, conviction of which not only results in a fine or imprisonment or both, but the convicted person becomes incapable for a period of\n7 years from the date of his or her conviction of being registered as an elector or of voting at any election under the Act or of being elected as the President or an MP.\nTo ensure that voters are aware of who is communicating to them and enable voters to assess the credibility of the information they rely on when forming their political judgment and selecting their representatives in the Parliament, every election advertising published in Singapore must show on or in it, and in the manner (including language) prescribed by the election advertising regulations, the identity particulars of all the following persons:\n(a) any person who authorised making available to the general public the election advertising;\n(b) any person who approved the content in the election advertising, if the content is approved before the election advertising was published if the person is not in paragraph (a). It does not matter whether or not that person is also a person who paid for any part of the production of the content or the publication of the election advertising;\n(c) any person for whom or at whose direction the election advertising was published if the person is not in paragraph (a) or (b).\nThis is intended to ensure that the information to voters is useful as covering the person who is actually responsible for the publishing of election advertising or having sufficient authority to publish the content without the content being approved by someone else, rather than other persons involved in the publication process who may not necessarily be responsible.\nAs is the present law today, if the election advertising is printed, the identity particulars of the printer must also be shown on or in it.\nThe new section 61B(1) adds a new requirement for election advertising that is paid for (which includes distribution or production). For every election advertising published in Singapore where all or part of the production of the content that is or includes the election advertising, or the publication of the election advertising, is paid for in money or money's worth by the person or by another person, the election advertising has to show on or in it, and in the manner (including language) prescribed by the election advertising regulations \u2014\n(a) the fact that the production of the content that is or includes the election advertising, or the publication of the election advertising (as the case may be) is paid for; and\n(b) the identity particulars of the person who paid to produce the content that is or includes the election advertising, or the publication of the election advertising, as the case may be.\nThe new section 61S(1) defines what is money's worth.\nThe new section 61B(1) applies where the election advertising is published on its own, as part of other content or made available contained in something else, such as a thumb drive containing a text or film of a political party's manifesto or a candidate's speeches.\nUnder the new section 61B(2), a similar set of \"published-by\" requirements applies to election advertising which is publicly displayed, whether on its own or contained in something else (like a QR code on a poster).\nClause 2 inserts in section 2 a new definition of \"publicly display\" relating to visible content. Content is taken to be publicly displayed if the content is displayed within a public place or in any place in a way so that anyone in a public place can see the content from inside or outside the firstmentioned place.\nFor example, a printer is contracted to print handbills with an election slogan supplied by A, who is one of the senior campaign staff for candidate X. A developed the content of the slogan and provided it to the printer after consulting the election agent of candidate X. Every handbill distributed to the general public by volunteers given by the election agent of candidate X an authority to conduct election activity, has to bear on its face, the identity particulars of \u2014\n(a) candidate X for whom the handbill is published;\n(b) the election agent of candidate X at whose direction and authorisation the handbills are distributed to the general public;\n(c) A who approved the content of the slogan; and\n(d) the printer even though the printer does not approve the content of the slogan and the printer did not make the decision to distribute the handbills.\nThe names of the volunteers who are carrying out the distribution of the handbills do not need to be included as they are in no position to make the decision to distribute the handbills.\nIn another example, a marketing firm is engaged by the Sky Party to run the general election campaign as the Sky Party is fielding several candidates in the general election. The marketing firm designs a communications strategy using a wide range of media including using blimps with an eye-catching design comprising the Sky Party logo and manifesto, internet advertisements, bulk text messages and voice calls through a call centre, boosting the search results of the\nSky Party in commonly used Internet search engines, and celebrity endorsement using social media influencers.\nThe marketing firm directs a social media influencer to post on the account of the social media influencer, a positive post about the political party. The social media influencer does so without anything in return as she feels passionately that the political party is best for the country. The contents of the post were approved by the political party. The message posted on the account of the social media influencer has to bear on its face \u2014\n(a) the identity particulars of the social media influencer since she retains ultimate control over what she says or will not say in the post using her account;\n(b) the identity particulars of the marketing firm who directed the post to be made;\n(c) the identity particulars of the political party which approved the content of the post and who paid for the production and publication of the content; and\n(d) the fact that the post is sponsored since the marketing firm's services were paid for despite the social media influencer not receiving any money or money's worth for posting.\nEven if the marketing firm refuses any payment for running the general election campaign, whether in cash or in kind, all posts by the social media influencer that the marketing firm has produced and distributed for the Sky Party must bear all the abovementioned particulars except the fact that the post is sponsored.\nEven if the social media influencer was contracted and remunerated by the marketing firm to post the content, her identity particulars should still be shown, as she has control over making the content available using her account and authorises the publication.\nThe blimps showing the design comprising the Sky Party logo and manifesto are arranged by the marketing firm to be deployed by tethering to grounds outside several shopping centres. A specialised balloonist business is contracted by the marketing firm to carry out the deployment. The design depicted on the blimp is produced by an in-house artist of the marketing firm and is approved by the Sky\nParty with a few edits. The message on the blimp has to bear on its face \u2014\n(a) the identity particulars of the marketing firm that made the arrangements for the blimp to be deployed;\n(b) the identity particulars of the Sky Party which approved the design and that paid the marketing firm to design a communications strategy which included the use of blimps;\n(c) the identity particulars of the specialised balloonist business if it printed the design on the balloon signs supplied; and\n(d) the fact that the election advertising is sponsored since the use of blimps and the grounds around the shopping centres had to be paid for.\nThe identity particulars of the specialised balloonist business do not need to be included if it did not print the design on the balloons it supplied because the specialised balloonist business does not make the decision whether to deploy the blimps.\nIn another example, candidate X sees an online post from the incumbent MP, against whom he is running, making an electoral promise. Candidate X reposts his opponent's post, with the comment \"Shameful reversal of earlier promises! Which voter can now believe you?\". Here, the incumbent MP had authorised the original post. Candidate X authorises the repost (which includes the original post) and his comment on it. Candidate X has to include his identity particulars.\nHowever, the provider of the electronic service used to post the messages does not need to be identified in either post so long as the service provider did not make the decision to post, does not approve the content or the post and does nothing to the nature or content of the post. The electronic service provider does not authorise the post.\nFinally, B feels passionately that candidate X is the best candidate running in B's single member constituency and B hires a local call centre to ring people in his constituency to convince them to vote for candidate X. B provides a script to the call centre to use and asks the call centre to proceed with contacting voters by calling or by sending an SMS message. The calls must mention the identity particulars of the call centre as the call centre would decide who to ring up or send\nan SMS message, as well as of B as B approved the content (the script) of the election advertising. The fact that the calls were paid for must also be included.\nHowever, the provider of the telephone service used by the call centre does not authorise the publishing as the telephone service provider did not make the decision to call the voters.\nThere are exceptions to the \"published-by\" requirements in the new section 61B.\nThe requirements do not apply to election advertising which is so small or of a certain design that makes it impracticable for such particulars to be included in or on the election advertising.\nThe requirements also do not apply to any communication of content between\n2 or more individuals that is of a private or domestic nature by electronic means.\nThe last key exception to the \"published-by\" requirements is for the publication of any Internet content by any individual who is a citizen of Singapore and not a candidate or an election agent, who does so at no other person's direction and on no other person's behalf and who does not receive or agree to receive, and who does not contract for, any money or money's worth, for or in connection with his or her publishing that content on the Internet.\nThe new section 61C sets out the offence of publishing, or causing to be published, or publicly displaying or causing to be publicly displayed, in Singapore any content or any thing containing content during the cooling-off period of an election in an electoral division, being content that is or includes election advertising related to the election. This replaces the present offence that is in section 78B.\nThe term \"cooling-off period\" is defined to mean the period starting the eve of polling day of an election and ending with the close of polling on polling day at that election.\nThe new section 61D sets out exceptions to the election advertising ban during the cooling-off period. The exceptions are not fixed and can be expanded in future via the election advertising regulations.\nThe new section 61E seeks to secure a level electoral playing field between the issue of the writ of election for an election in a constituency and before the start of the campaign period for an election in that constituency.\nThe new section 61E contains a strict liability offence of publicly displaying, or causing to be publicly displayed, during that abovementioned period, any traditional election advertising in the constituency, if the traditional election advertising contains an express or implicit reference to a political party \u2014\n(a) by its name or symbol; or\n(b) by another symbol which can reasonably be regarded as indicating a direct association or an immediate affiliation with the political party.\nThe new Division 2 sets out controls which apply to candidates and political parties whereas the new Division 3 contains a ban on election advertising by foreigners and foreign entities, and controls that apply to third parties, which are defined to mean anyone who is neither a candidate, an election agent nor a political party. The restrictions apply to an objectively defined group of persons who freely choose to play a prominent role in political debate.\nThe new Division 2 consists of 5 new sections dealing with activities in the campaign period of an election in an electoral division.\nThe new section 61F deals only with election advertising that is either online election advertising published in Singapore, or non-online election advertising published in Singapore by undertaking any electronic communications activity.\nA candidate in an election, or a political party with one or more candidates at the election, who publishes any such election advertising in Singapore, during the campaign period, or anyone publishing such election advertising in Singapore during the campaign period, on behalf of a candidate or such a political party commits an offence if the election advertising \u2014\n(a) was not declared to the Returning Officer within a certain time; or\n(b) has a functionality prescribed in the election advertising regulations as impermissible for that form of election advertising, or does not have a functionality prescribed in the election advertising regulations as requisite for that election advertising.\nThe timeline for declaring the election advertising is like what is presently set out in the Parliamentary Elections (Election Advertising) Regulations (Rg 3).\nThe new section 61F extends to cover any subsequent step taken by or on behalf of anyone to amplify the access to an earlier published content on the Internet by persons physically present in Singapore. For example, by sharing or boosting the search engine results for the earlier posted content. Please refer to the amendments in clause 2.\nThe new sections 61G to 61J relate only to traditional election advertising activities during the campaign period and set out what is substantially the permit regime for posters and banners set out in the Parliamentary Elections (Election\nAdvertising) Regulations, but with a few additional restrictions.\nThe new section 61G covers traditional election advertising by or on behalf of a candidate or political party, during the campaign period of an election in a constituency. It makes it an offence to publicly display, or cause to be publicly displayed, during the period any traditional election advertising in the electoral\ndivision or in or on any conveyance, thing or structure, whether mobile or stationary, in the electoral division.\nThe traditional election advertising covered is one that relates to the election in question. Clause 2 introduces an interpretive provision which states that an election advertising relates to an election if it contains an express or implicit reference to \u2014\n(a) the election in the electoral division;\n(b) an individual who is a candidate at the election in the electoral division in his or her capacity as a candidate (and not in some other capacity, like as a Town Councillor or political office holder);\n(c) a political party, or the interests of a political party, with one or more candidates at the election in the electoral division; or\n(d) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in the election.\nAny other content in the form of a banner, flag or poster and which does not contain any of the above will not be banned under the new section 61G.\nHowever, the new section 61G does not apply to or in relation to the public display of any traditional election advertising under the authority of a permit granted by the Returning Officer. There are also other exceptions described in the new section 61G(5).\nThe new section 61H makes it an offence to publicly display in a constituency traditional election advertising more than the maximum prescribed in the election advertising regulations for that type of traditional election advertising.\nThe new section 61I requires all traditional election advertising to be publicly displayed only in a positive list of permissible locations. It makes it an offence for a candidate or political party to publicly display, or cause to be publicly displayed, during the campaign period relating to an election in an electoral division, any traditional election advertising in any place in the electoral division which is a place that is not on the positive list of permissible locations, and the person knows or has reason to believe that the place is an impermissible location.\nThe new section 61J relates to the offence of displaying traditional election advertising within the restricted signage zone of an ordinary polling station or a special polling station. The restricted signage zone is roughly a 50-metre zone around an ordinary polling station or a special polling station.\nThe new Division 3 consists of 3 new sections dealing with activities undertaken by third parties during the election period of an election in the electoral division and a ban on election advertising by foreigners and foreign entities.\nThe new section 61K makes it an offence for a third party at an election in an electoral division to undertake electronic communications activity that results in\nor involves publishing in Singapore, at any time during the election period of an election in the electoral division, any content in any way that renders the content accessible from the Internet, and if all or part of the production of the content that is or includes the online election advertising or the publication of the online election advertising, is paid for in money or money's worth by the third party or by another person who may or may not be a third party.\nThis is permissible only if the third party was granted a written authority under section 83(2), signed by a candidate or a candidate's election agent.\nThe new section 61K does not criminalise third party election advertising on the\nInternet if that is not paid for in money or money's worth by the third party or by another person who may or may not be a third party.\nThe new section 61L is a corresponding offence for third party activities involving non-online election advertising. The difference is that there is no exception for unpaid for third party election advertising if these are not online.\nThe new section 61M re-enacts section 83(1A) which contains a ban on foreign individuals publishing or displaying election advertising during the election period of an election. The new section 61M extends the ban to foreign entities. The expressions \"foreigner\" and \"foreign entity\" are inserted by amendments in clause 2.\nThe new Division 4 contains enforcement provisions, defences to offences under the new Divisions 1, 2 and 3 and definitions of terms which are used only in the new Divisions.\nThe new section 61N empowers the Returning Officer to issue corrective directions to certain relevant persons where he or she reasonably believes that an offence under the new section 61C, 61F, 61K, 78C (election survey results), 78D (exit polls) or 83(5) (publishing without authorisation by candidate or election agent) is being or has been committed, resulting in or involving publishing in\nSingapore any online election advertisement.\nThe relevant persons are \u2014\n(a) a candidate at an election in an electoral division;\n(b) a political party with one or more candidates at an election in an electoral division;\n(c) a third party in relation to an election in an electoral division who is connected with the commission of the offence but not a person mentioned in paragraph (d); or\n(d) a provider of a social media service, a relevant electronic service or an internet access service.\nThe corrective directions can require a relevant person to take all reasonable steps to ensure the removal, from the social media service, relevant electronic service or internet access service (as the case may be) of the online election advertising identified in the direction, or to disable access to the online election advertising on the social media service, relevant electronic service or internet access service (as the case may be) by end-users in Singapore who use or may use the service.\nThe corrective direction may also require a relevant person to take all reasonable steps to stop or reduce electronic communications activity involving, provision of or access to, or further electronic communications activity involving, further provision of or access to, that online election advertising by end-users in\nSingapore of the social media service, relevant electronic service or internet access service.\nA relevant person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction given commits an offence.\nThe new section 61O confers on the Returning Officer powers to deal with traditional election advertising which is the subject of offences. Where the\nReturning Officer reasonably believes that an offence under the new section 61C, 61E, 61G, 61H, 61I or 61J is being committed, the Returning Officer may direct any person \u2014\n(a) to either remove or cause to be removed, or to otherwise stop any public display of, any traditional election advertising that is publicly displayed in connection with that offence; and\n(b) to do so within the period specified in the direction, or any extension of that period that the Returning Officer may allow in any particular case.\nThe person directed can be any person, unlike the closed list in the new section 61N. The person directed under the new section 61O need not be a candidate, political party or election agent or person who committed the offence.\nA person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with any direction given to the person by the Returning Officer commits an offence. At the same time, if any such direction is not complied with to the satisfaction of the Returning\nOfficer, the Returning Officer may carry out or take steps or cause to be carried out any work or any steps to be taken, which are in the Returning Officer's opinion necessary to secure compliance with the direction, including removing or causing to be removed any traditional election advertising and detaining the traditional election advertising at a holding yard or other place, or stopping any public display of any traditional election advertising.\nThe new section 61P is an evidentiary provision.\nThe new section 61Q sets out defences to offences in the new Division 1, 2 or 3.\nThe new section 61R contains power for the Minister to make election advertising regulations.\nThe new section 61S contains supplementary interpretive provisions.\nThe new section 61S(6) and (7) also makes clear that the offences in the new\nDivisions of Part 3 or section 78C or 78D, or in the election advertising regulations, involving publishing content by electronic means extend to a person who engages in any conduct that constitutes an offence described in the respective provision either wholly or partly in Singapore, or wholly outside Singapore and as a result of that conduct, the offence occurs wholly or partly in Singapore. In short, there is extra-territorial application.\nClause 31 amends section 62, which concerns the appointment of election agents and principal election agents.\nThe amendments deal with an instance where there is no appointment in force of an election agent of a candidate for the election. The new section 62(2A) deems the candidate both as a candidate and as an election agent.\nWhen there is no appointment in force of a principal election agent for a group of candidates in an election, but there are appointments of election agents in force, the election agent of the candidate whose name is to appear first in the group in the ballot papers under section 40(3)(a), will be treated as appointed as the principal election agent of the group in relation to the election.\nThe other amendments are housekeeping changes. The amendments will dispense with the sole reliance on hardcopy appointment forms to notify the\nReturning Officer of appointments of election agents or changes in appointments and will allow the use of an electronic system instead.\nClause 32 amends section 63 by introducing a new disqualification to be an election agent. An individual who is an undischarged bankrupt will be disqualified from being an election agent.\nClause 33 amends section 64 on the appointment of polling agents. The amendment provides that the candidate or, in the case of a group of candidates, any candidate in the group may \u2014\n(a) make any such appointment; and\n(b) inform the presiding officer at each polling station in writing of the name of every polling agent appointed to act.\nClause 34 amends section 74 which will empower the Returning Officer to issue one or more guidelines for the purpose of providing practical guidance or certainty in respect of any of the requirements of section 74 on the filing of returns respecting election expenses. The guidelines may cover what must be or need not be disclosed in any returns respecting election expenses.\nIn court proceedings for an illegal practice involving any returns respecting election expenses, compliance with a provision of any guideline so issued, or a contravention of or a failure to comply with such a guideline, which is found by the court to be relevant to a matter to which a contravention or failure alleged in the proceedings relates, may be relied on by any party to those proceedings as tending to negative or establish any liability which is in question in those proceedings.\nClause 35 introduces a new section 74A which provides a means by which an election agent, together with the candidate, can make corrections to returns for election expenses filed with the Returning Officer. However, the corrections must be made before the expiry of the time delimited by section 74(1) for the transmission to the Returning Officer of returns respecting election expenses and the related statements. The amendment does not affect the courts' power to grant an authorised excuse under section 88 for non-compliance with provisions as to returns and statements respecting election expenses.\nClause 36 amends section 75 to enable the Returning Officer to provide public notice of returns respecting election expenses using more modern methods. The amendments will allow for online access to these returns.\nClause 37 amends section 75A to empower the Returning Officer to audit (or cause to be audited by a person approved by the Returning Officer) any returns respecting election expenses transmitted under section 74(1) or 74A(1) (as the case may be) by an election agent of a candidate on behalf of the candidate.\nThe audit is to be carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards with a view to reporting whether \u2014\n(a) the return respecting election expenses presents fairly the content contained in the supporting documents on which it is based; and\n(b) the provisions of the Act relating to returns respecting election expenses and any statement or declaration relating thereto have been in all respects complied with.\nClause 38 repeals sections 78, 78A and 78B because of clause 30.\nClause 39 amends section 78C (which bans publishing the results of election surveys between the day the writ of election is issued for an election and ending with the close of all polling stations on polling day at the election) to make clear that the survey may involve voters and not necessarily electors whose names are entered in a register of electors, and the results may be those purporting to be that of a survey of voters.\nBy reason of the amendments in clause 2 to section 2, section 78C extends to cover any subsequent step taken by or on behalf of anyone to amplify the access to an earlier published election survey result on the Internet by persons physically\npresent in Singapore. For example, by sharing or boosting the search engine results for the earlier posted content.\nClause\namends section 78E by removing cross-references to sections 61(1)(c) and 78B(1) and to regulations made under section 78A(1)(b), as these are made redundant by the amendments in clause 30.\nClause 41 amends section 82 (on undue influence at or near polling stations) to better define a restricted zone for a polling station, within which there can be no loitering on polling day. This is to overcome operational difficulties where the polling station is situated within a larger setting, like a school.\nA restricted zone for a polling station means the building, or part of the building, in which any polling place of the polling station or any polling booth or other facility for electors allotted to that polling station are to vote. The restricted zone is also the area within 200 metres of the external edges of such a building or part of a building.\nIf the Returning Officer or a presiding officer of that polling station has designated entrances to the grounds under section 36A(4), the area within\n200 metres of each designated entrance to those grounds is the restricted zone for that polling station.\nThe 200-metre zone does not extend to premises that are outside Singapore.\nClause 42 amends section 83 which deals with taking part in and conducting of election activity.\nThe first amendment is to section 83(1)(a) to replace the present ban on individuals attending a primary or secondary school as a student from taking part in election activity with a ban on individuals who are below 16 years of age.\nThere is a corresponding amendment to section 83(6) to prohibit any candidate or an election agent authorising anyone to conduct an election activity, knowing or having reason to believe that the person is below 16 years of age.\nClause 42 also amends section 83 to ban foreign entities and foreign individuals from taking part in or conducting election activity. The terms \"foreigner\" and \"foreign entity\" are defined by the amendments in clause 2. There is however a facility to carve out foreign individuals from the ban by regulations.\nSection 83(1)(c) is also repealed by clause 42. This abolishes the ban on undischarged bankrupts taking part in election activities.\nSection 83 is further amended to exclude an activity which the new section 61K (on third party election advertising on the Internet) does not criminalise. As amended, \"election activity\" excludes a third party publishing, or causing to be published any content in any way that renders the content accessible from the\nInternet, where all or part of the production of the content or its publication is not\npaid for, in money or money's worth, by the third party or by another person who may or may not be a third party.\nFinally, the current section 83(1A) is repealed as it is re-enacted as the new section 61M.\nClause 43 amends section 99(1)(a), which deals with the striking out of votes on a scrutiny at the hearing of an application under section 90 to set aside an election result. The amendment has to set out more circumstances where the votes cast need to be struck off because of the introduction of special voting arrangements and postal voting.\nClause 44 introduces a new section 102Awhich empowers the Minister to make regulations to enable contingency arrangements to be put in place, should they be required, to enable a Returning Officer to conduct safe, orderly, efficient and timely elections and support the resilience of Singapore's democracy, because of a disruptive event which has occurred or is likely to occur, before or during any stage of an election, in Singapore or in a country where there is established one or more overseas polling stations and which prevents or seriously interrupts, or is likely to prevent or seriously interrupt, the conduct of the election according to the\nAct.\nThe regulations will replace the present sections 56A, 56B, 56BA, 56C, 56D, 56DA, 56DB, 56E and 56F. This will provide for greater flexibility for measures to be devised to deal with these unusual situations, instead of having to amend the\nAct. While the regulations may modify the provisions of the Act, the regulations must not authorise any person to vote more than once at an election and must preserve voting in secret.\nThe regulations may also provide for the witnessing or attesting to any thing (but not voting) through the use of remote communication technology, such as by video conferencing, tele-conferencing or other electronic means.\nA disruptive event is defined as what is presently in sections 56A, 56B, 56BA, 56C, 56D, 56DA, 56DB, 56E and 56F but is expanded to cover more natural disasters which occur regionally, such as an eruption, earthquake, landslip or haze, and events like transport accidents and unplanned and prolonged outage of any telecommunication or electricity service, or an information and communications system, which is essential for the proper conduct of an election.\nClause 44 also introduces a new section 102B which requires all regulations made under the Act to be presented to Parliament as soon as possible after publication in the Gazette. There is also a blackout period during which no regulations may be made. This period starts when a writ of election has been issued under section 24 for an election in any electoral division and ends after the day of nomination or, if a poll is to be taken, after polling day of that election.\nClause 45 introduces a new section 110, which deals with the service of documents permitted or required to be served on a person for the purposes of the\nAct. The new section 110 does not deal with service of court documents like summonses, as these are regulated by the Rules of Court or other written laws.\nThe new modes of service introduced follow the technological advances in communications. Service by fax is provided for. Service by email is also permissible. Service is also permitted by giving an electronic notice to the individual, partnership, body corporate or unincorporated association (called an addressee) by the addressee's chosen means of notification, stating that the document is available and how the addressee may use the addressee's chosen means of access to access the document's contents. For example, a recipient of a notice may choose to be notified by a mobile phone application that notifies the person that a notice to the person is available to be accessed on a website maintained by the Government.\nThe new section 110 also provides for special service arrangements for a person where, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the name of the person to whom the document is to be served, or the business address, residential address or last email address of the person, cannot be ascertained. The document may be served by posting it on a website maintained by the Government and prescribed by the\nMinister by notification in the Gazette for this purpose.\nHowever, service of any document on a person by email or by an electronic notice at the person's chosen means of notification may be effected only with the person's prior consent to service in that way. The consent may be given expressly or impliedly.\nClause 46 contains consequential amendments to definitions in the Foreign\nInterference (Countermeasures) Act 2021 occasioned by amendments in clauses 30, 31 and 44.\nRelated to amendments in clause 42 to section 83, which will ban foreign entities and foreign individuals from taking part in or conducting election activity, clause 46 makes amendments to the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures)\nAct 2021 to correct some cross-reference and phrasing omissions in provisions containing countermeasures for counteracting acts of foreign interference through electronic communications activity by or on behalf of foreign principals, countermeasures against such acts relating to political donations to politically significant persons such as candidates and political parties, and countermeasures against acts of foreign interference through politically significant persons' foreign affiliations (in addition to political donations).\nClause 47 makes a consequential amendment to section 2(4) of the Town\nCouncils Act 1988 on the meaning of election results, by including results in an uncontested election as per the text in clause 11.\nClause 48 confers power on the Minister to make regulations prescribing provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of any clause in the Bill as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient. The regulations must be done within a 2-year time limit.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

Clause 3(3) sets out the matters to be considered in determining whether a person is lending money on the security of a pledge, and whether goods have been pawned. Generally, regard is to be had to the substance of the transaction and not to its form or legal technicalities. Clause 3(4) provides that the First Schedule may specify transactions where goods are deemed to be or deemed not to be pawned. Where goods are deemed to be pawned, the First Schedule may specify the person deemed to be the pawner, the sum deemed to be loaned and the profit deemed to be taken for the loan.\nClause 4 excludes from the application of the Bill entities that are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore under any written law, to the extent that such entities are allowed or not prohibited from carrying on the business of pawnbroking under such written law.\nClause 5 provides for a Registrar of Pawnbrokers (the Registrar) to be appointed by the Minister, and empowers the Minister to appoint Deputy Registrars of\nPawnbrokers and Assistant Registrars of Pawnbrokers.\nPART 2\nPart 2 (consisting of 7 Divisions) concerns the regulation of pawnbrokers and related matters.\nDivision 1 (consisting of clauses 6 to 11) concerns the licensing of pawnbrokers.\nClause 6 makes it an offence to carry on the business of pawnbroking in\nSingapore save in accordance with the Bill.\nClause 7 empowers the Registrar to grant a pawnbroking licence in accordance with the Bill.\nClause 8 provides for the duration of a licence.\nClause 9 empowers the Registrar to renew a licence, and provides for the duration of a renewed licence.\nClause 10 provides that a licence must not be granted to a person other than a company incorporated in Singapore. A licence must also not be granted or renewed in such circumstances as may be prescribed. The clause also sets out particular grounds on which the Registrar may refuse to grant or renew a licence.\nClause 11 provides for an appeal to the Minister against the Registrar's refusal to grant or renew a licence.\nDivision 2 (consisting of clauses 12 to 17) concerns the approval of the substantial shareholders, directors and managers of a licensee.\nClause 12(1) makes it an offence for a person to (a) become a substantial shareholder of a licensee without the Registrar's approval; (b) increase the person's substantial shareholding in a licensee without the Registrar's approval; or (c) refuse to comply with the Registrar's direction to reduce the person's substantial shareholding in a licensee. Clause 12(2) provides that clause 12(1)(a) does not apply to a person who becomes a substantial shareholder without any increase in the person's shareholding. Clause 12(3) empowers the Registrar to give the relevant approvals and directions.\nClause 13 sets out particular grounds on which approval under clause 12(2) may be refused or withdrawn.\nClause 14(1) prohibits a person from being appointed or acting as a director or manager of a licensee without the Registrar's approval. Clause 14(2) provides that, when a person contravenes clause 14(1), the person and the licensee are each guilty of an offence. Clause 14(3) empowers the Registrar to give and withdraw the necessary approvals.\nClause 15 sets out particular grounds on which approval under clause 14(3) may be refused or withdrawn.\nClause 16 requires the Registrar to give an affected person an opportunity to make representations before giving a direction under clause 12(2)(c) or withdrawing any approval under clause 14(3)(b).\nClause 17 provides for an appeal to the Minister against the Registrar's decision to refuse any approval under clause 12(2)(a) or (b), to give a direction under clause 12(2)(c), to refuse any approval under clause 14(3)(a) or to withdraw any approval under clause 14(3)(b).\nDivision 3 (consisting of clauses 18 to 29) concerns the conditions of a licence and the statutory duties of a licensee.\nClause 18 requires a licensee to comply with the conditions of its licence. The clause also empowers the Registrar to specify and vary licence conditions, whether generally or specifically.\nClause 19 requires a licensee to comply with its statutory duties in clauses 20 to\n29. Failure to do so is an offence.\nClause 20 requires a licensee to maintain the prescribed paid-up share capital.\nClause 21 prohibits a licensee from carrying on the business of pawnbroking other than at a licensed place of business, and from carrying on any business other than pawnbroking at a licensed place of business. A licensee must also keep its licensed place of business in a suitable condition for carrying on the business of pawnbroking.\nClause 22 requires a licensee to display, at each of its licensed places of business, a conspicuous sign stating its name and the words \"Pawnbroker's Shop\", \"Pawnbroker\" or \"Pawnshop\". A licensee must also display a conspicuous notice stating the maximum profit and fees it can charge under clause 50.\nClause 23 requires a licensee to keep records in relation to its business of pawnbroking and its pawnbroking transactions.\nClause 24 requires a licensee to submit a statement on its business of pawnbroking and its pawnbroking transactions to the Registrar at specified intervals. The statement must contain the prescribed particulars and the Registrar may require the licensee to account for or explain any of those particulars.\nClause 25 requires a licensee to conduct annual audits of its business.\nClause 26 requires a licensee to maintain insurance against the damage, theft or loss of pledges taken by it.\nClause 27 requires a licensee to maintain the prescribed security deposit, and to replace the deposit if it is forfeited. The deposit will secure the licensee's compliance with its licence conditions and the provisions of the Bill.\nClause 28 requires a licensee to inform the Registrar if a substantial shareholder, director or manager of the licensee is or has become a disqualified person.\nClause 29 requires a licensee to inform the Registrar of certain events. The events are generally those that may lead to the end of the licensee, or an entity that is a substantial shareholder of the licensee, as a going concern.\nDivision 4 (consisting of clauses 30 to 33) sets out the investigative powers of the Registrar.\nClause 30 empowers the Registrar to order a person to produce any information, document or thing in the person's possession or control that the Registrar considers relevant for deciding whether the provisions of the Bill have been contravened, or to give the Registrar access to such information, document or thing. The\nRegistrar's power does not extend to customer information kept by a financial institution.\nClause 31 empowers the Registrar to seize any property related to a contravention of the Bill and, alternatively, to prohibit any person from dealing with such property. The Registrar's power does not apply to property held or suspected to be held in an account or a safe deposit box in a financial institution.\nThe occupier or person-in-charge of the place where property is to be seized may attend during the seizure. The Registrar must prepare a signed list of any property seized, and a signed copy must be given to the occupier or person-in-charge.\nClause 32 provides for sections 370, 371 and 372 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode (Cap. 68) (concerning the reporting of seized property to a Magistrate's Court and the disposal of the property by the Court) to apply when the Registrar seizes property or prohibits any dealing in property under clause 31. In addition, when the\nRegistrar seizes a pledge or prohibits any dealing in a pledge under clause 31, the court may at any time order the pledge to be released to a person interested in the pledge or deal with the pledge as it sees fit.\nClause 33 provides for the Registrar's powers and duties under Division 4 to be exercised and performed by persons authorised by the Registrar.\nDivision 5 (consisting of clauses 34 to 39) sets out the regulatory actions that the Registrar may take.\nClause 34 empowers the Registrar to give directions to a licensee.\nClause 35 empowers the Minister to prescribe any offence under the Bill to be a compoundable offence. It also empowers the Registrar to compound a compoundable offence.\nClause 36 empowers the Registrar to revoke a licence in certain circumstances, e.g. if the licensee is convicted of an offence under the Bill. Alternatively, the\nRegistrar may suspend a licence or vary the conditions of the licence, or both.\nClause 37 empowers the Registrar to impose a financial penalty in certain circumstances. The payment of a financial penalty may be enforced by forfeiting the security deposit placed by the licensee under clause 27. The clause does not apply when a licensee contravenes a provision of the Bill, which contravention amounts to an offence.\nClause 38 requires the Registrar to give a licensee the opportunity to make representations before taking action under clause 36 or 37.\nClause 39 provides for an appeal to the Minister against the Registrar's decision under clause 36 or 37.\nDivision 6 (consisting of clauses 40 to 42) concerns the lapsing, expiry or revocation of a licence.\nClause 40 defines the circumstances where a licence lapses.\nClause 41 provides for the Registrar's powers in \"end-of-life\" scenarios, i.e.\nwhere a licence lapses or expires, or where the licensee has been informed of the\nRegistrar's decision to revoke the licence. The powers are intended to secure the orderly cessation of the licensee's pawnbroking business, protect the interest of pawners and secure the licensee's compliance with the provisions of the Bill. For these purposes, the Registrar may give directions to the licensee, any director or manager of the licensee, or a person who was a director of the licensee 6 months before the relevant \"end-of-life\" event. The Registrar may, in particular, direct that the licensee delivers its records to the Registrar, and keeps its premises open for the redemption of pledges, among other things.\nClause 42 provides that the lapsing, expiration or revocation of a licence does not affect the validity of any transaction entered into by the licensee.\nDivision 7 (consisting of clauses 43 to 47) relates to waivers from the provisions of the Bill.\nClause 43 empowers the Minister to issue a waiver certificate for the waiver of the application of all or any of the requirements of the Bill as they concern a person.\nThe waiver may be conditional or unconditional.\nClause 44 empowers the Minister to vary or revoke a waiver certificate granted under clause 43.\nClause 45 requires the Minister to give a person the opportunity to make representations before varying or revoking a waiver certificate granted to the person.\nClause 46 empowers the Minister to make rules for the waiver of the application of any (but not all) of the requirements of the Bill as they concern any class of persons. The class waiver may be conditional or unconditional.\nClause 47 provides that the variation or revocation of a waiver certificate or class waiver does not affect the validity of transactions entered into by a person before the variation or revocation.\nPART 3\nPart 3 (consisting of 4 Divisions) sets out the rights and obligations when goods are pawned. The provisions are directed at transactions with pawnbrokers. They therefore do not apply to the pawning of goods in other contexts, which will remain governed by the common law.\nDivision 1 (consisting of clauses 48 to 51) deals with the pawning of goods.\nClause 48 requires a pawnbroker to give a valuation of goods offered to be pawned before lending money on the security of a pledge. This will help a person make an informed decision whether to pawn goods. A loan agreement will be voidable at the instance of the pawner unless such a valuation is given. The pawnbroker will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by any person relying on the valuation, unless the pawnbroker did not act in good faith or with reasonable care in giving the valuation.\nClause 49 requires a pawn ticket to be issued when a pawnbroker lends money on the security of a pledge. The pawn ticket must contain the prescribed particulars.\nA copy of the pawn ticket must be signed by the pawner. The pawnbroker must keep a signed copy of the pawn ticket. A loan agreement will be voidable at the instance of the pawner unless these requirements are fully complied with.\nClause 50 prohibits a pawnbroker from taking profit on a loan or from charging any fee other than what is permitted under the Second Schedule. A loan agreement will be void to the extent that it provides otherwise. The maximum rate of profit allowed under the Second Schedule is 1.5% of the loan per month, and the pawnbroker is prohibited from taking profit 2 months after the expiry of the redemption period.\nClause 51 provides that, when the redemption period for a pledge is extended by agreement, clauses 48, 49 and 50 will apply as if the pledge is offered to be pawned for the first time, with certain modifications. The pawnbroker must therefore give a fresh valuation as required by clause 48 and issue a new pawn ticket as required by clause 49; the pawnbroker is also subject to the limits on profit and fees imposed by clause 50 and the Second Schedule. The modifications are (a) the pawnbroker must cancel the original pawn ticket; (b) the new pawn ticket issued by the pawnbroker must state the profit due at the date of the agreement to extend the redemption period; and (c) the rights and obligations under the original agreement to pawn the goods are deemed to have merged in the agreement to extend the redemption\nperiod. Also, if the pawnbroker fails to give a valuation in accordance with clause 48(1), or purports to charge any profit or fee not permitted under clause 50 and the Second Schedule, the validity of the agreement to extend the redemption period will not be affected but the pawnbroker will not be entitled to take any profit on the loan in respect of the extended redemption period.\nDivision 2 (consisting of clauses 52 to 60) relates to the redemption of pledges.\nClause 52 specifies the persons who are entitled to redeem a pledge.\nClause 53 provides that a pawn ticket and the right to redeem a pledge may be freely assigned or transferred. An agreement will void to the extent that it purports to prevent or fetter the assignment or transfer of a pawn ticket or the right to redeem a pledge. The provisions are intended to protect a pawner who is unable to redeem a pledge. Such a pawner will be able to recover part of the value of the pledge through selling the pawn ticket.\nClause 54 provides that a pledge may be redeemed at any time during the redemption period, and at any time thereafter but before it is forfeited. The redemption period is defined as 6 months after the date on which the pledge was made, or such longer period as parties may agree. If the redemption so defined ends on a non-business day, it is extended to the next business day.\nClause 55 provides that the redemption period may be extended by agreement between the pawnbroker and a person entitled to redeem the pledge.\nClause 56 sets out how a pledge may be redeemed by a person entitled to redeem it. The person must present the pawn ticket, repay the pawnbroker the loan and interest secured by the pledge, and provide the person's identification information. These may be done at any time during the redemption period or before the pledge is forfeited.\nClause 57 requires a pawnbroker to allow a person who has complied with clause 56 to redeem a pledge, save in certain circumstances where the person presenting the pawn ticket may not be entitled to redeem the pledge.\nClause 58 provides that a pawnbroker is not liable to any person for any loss or damage when the pawnbroker allows or refuses to allow a pledge to be redeemed in accordance with clause 57. In the case of a beneficial owner of goods pawned without the owner's authority, this applies only if the pawnbroker has taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the pawner was the beneficial owner of the goods.\nClause 59 requires a pawnbroker to issue a receipt to a person redeeming a pledge and cancel the pawn ticket.\nClause 60 provides for the liability of a pawnbroker who is required under clause 57 to allow a person to redeem a pledge, but who is unable to produce a pledge, or unable to produce it in the same physical condition it was in when the\npawnbroker first took possession. If the pawnbroker is unable to produce the pledge, the pawnbroker will be liable for the pledge's value. If the pawnbroker is unable to produce the pledge in the same physical condition it was in when the pawnbroker first took possession, the person redeeming the pledge can choose from 2 remedies: (a) compensation by the pawnbroker for the value of the pledge; or (b) the return of the pledge, and compensation by the pawnbroker for any decrease in the value of the pledge caused by the change in physical condition. For these purposes, the pledge's value is taken to be that determined by the valuation given when the pawnbroker first took possession of the pledge.\nDivision 3 (consisting of clauses 61 to 65) relates to the statutory remedy of forfeiture, which will replace the existing requirement for sale by auction under the\nPawnbrokers Act (Cap. 222, 1994 Ed.).\nClause 61 provides that, unless it is earlier redeemed, a pledge is forfeited one month after the pawnbroker serves a notice of forfeiture in accordance with clauses 62 and 63. When a pledge is forfeited it becomes the pawnbroker's absolute property and the loan and any profit secured on it is deemed to be fully repaid. The pawnbroker therefore takes the risk and benefit of any difference between the pledge's value and the loan and interest secured on the pledge.\nClause 62 sets out the information that must be contained in a notice of forfeiture. This includes a statement that the pledge will be forfeited one month after the notice has been served, and that the pledge may be redeemed at any time before that; the amount to be paid to redeem the pledge or extend the redemption period; and a valuation of the pledge at the time the notice is issued. The information will help the pawner make an informed decision whether to redeem the pledge or, if the pawner is unable to redeem the pledge, to recover part of the value of the pledge by selling the pawn ticket and the right to redeem the pledge. The pawnbroker will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by any person relying on the valuation in the notice of forfeiture, unless the pawnbroker did not act in good faith or with reasonable care in giving the valuation.\nClause 63 requires a notice of forfeiture to be served within 2 months after the expiry of the redemption period, in the prescribed manner, and at the pawnbroker's cost.\nClause 64 excludes other remedies the pawnbroker may have in respect of the loan or profit secured by the pledge, provides that the pawnbroker may only realise its security interest in the pledge by forfeiture in accordance with clause 61. The effect is to make forfeiture the sole remedy of the pawnbroker. For example, the pawnbroker will not be able to sue for the loan or profit when these exceed the value of the pledge.\nClause 65 provides for the consequences if a pawnbroker purports to realise its security interest in a pledge other than by forfeiture in accordance with clause 61. If the pledge's value exceeds the loan and profit secured on it, the pawnbroker will be\nliable for the surplus. If the pledge's value is equal to or less than the loan and profit secured on it, the loan and profit are extinguished. For these purposes, the pledge's value is taken to be that determined by the valuation given when the pawnbroker first took possession of the pledge. In all cases the pawnbroker will not acquire any property in the pledge, and will therefore be unable to give good title to the pledge to third parties.\nDivision 4 (consisting of clauses 66 to 69) deals with related matters.\nClause 66 applies for the protection of a person entitled to redeem a pledge but who does not have a pawn ticket. Such a person may apply to a pawnbroker. Upon receiving an application, the pawnbroker must make reasonable inquiries and must thereafter issue a replacement pawn ticket to the applicant, unless the pawnbroker knows or has reason to believe that the matters stated in the application are materially false or incomplete. A pawnbroker which does or omits to do anything in accordance with the clause will be protected from liability to any person entitled to redeem the pledge.\nClause 67 applies for the protection of the rightful owner of goods that are wrongfully pawned. Such a person may serve a notice on the pawnbroker.\nClause 67(4) provides that, upon being served the notice, the pawnbroker must deal with the pledge in accordance with any court order. If there is no court order, the pawnbroker may refuse to deal with the pledge for 3 months after receiving the notice, and for so long thereafter as an action relating to the pledge is pending. A pawnbroker which does or omits to do anything in accordance with clause 67(4) will be protected from liability.\nClause 68 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires, nothing in Part 3 limits, restricts or affects any right, title, interest, privilege, obligation or liability of a person.\nClause 69 provides that any exclusion or modification of Part 3, or any rule of law relating to the pawning of goods, is void.\nPART 4\nPart 4 creates offences.\nClause 70 makes it an offence to provide false or misleading information to the\nRegistrar.\nClause 71 creates certain offences relating to the fraudulent, dishonest or otherwise wrongful pawning of goods and the redemption of pledges.\nClause 72 makes it an offence for a pawnbroker to take goods in pawn in certain circumstances, and to make an advance on pledge other than in money that is legal tender in Singapore.\nClause 73 requires a pawnbroker to detain goods and make a police report when it discovers that the goods are reported to the police as lost, stolen or fraudulently or dishonestly obtained. A pawnbroker which fails to do so commits an offence. The pawnbroker may also detain a person offering such goods to be pawned.\nPART 5\nPart 5 and the Third Schedule concern the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The provisions implement the relevant recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force in relation to pawnbrokers. The approach is risk- based.\nClause 74 requires a pawnbroker to implement adequate programmes and measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.\nClause 75 requires a pawnbroker to perform the customer due diligence measures, additional measures and measures relating to targeted financial sanctions specified in the Third Schedule. The measures include \u2014\n(a) verifying the identity of a pawner, any person for whom a pawner is acting and any beneficial owner of a pawner;\n(b) enhanced customer due diligence measures in certain circumstances;\n(c) assessing whether a pawner, any person for whom a pawner is acting and any beneficial owner of a pawner is a politically-exposed person; and\n(d) verifying whether a pawner, any person for whom a pawner is acting and any beneficial owner of a pawner is a terrorist or terrorist entity.\nClause 76 requires a pawnbroker to keep records in respect of the measures it is required to perform under the Third Schedule, and to make such records available to the Registrar and prescribed authorities upon request.\nPART 6\nPart 6 makes miscellaneous provisions.\nClause 77 confers certain powers on the court when goods are wrongfully pawned.\nClause 78 makes certain provisions concerning appeals to the Minister.\nClause 79 imposes general penalties for offences under the Bill for which no specific penalty is provided.\nClause 80 provides for the criminal liability of the officers of an entity when the entity commits an offence under the Bill.\nClause 81 confers jurisdiction on District and Magistrates' Courts to try any offence under the Bill and to impose the full punishment for the offence.\nClause 82 empowers the Minister to amend the First, Second and Third\nSchedules.\nClause 83 empowers the Minister to make rules for the purposes of the Bill.\nClause 84 repeals the Pawnbrokers Act (Cap. 222, 1994 Ed.).\nClause 85 makes savings and transitional provisions.\nClause 86 and the Fourth Schedule make consequential amendments to certain other written laws.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The exception is if the authorities in the territory where the act or omission occurred are entitled to exercise the criminal jurisdiction of that territory in respect of that act or omission, do not cede that jurisdiction to Singapore, and do in fact bring criminal proceedings against the person in that territory. The new section 105D(4) also provides that any disciplinary offence committed when serving overseas may be investigated and proceeded by way of disciplinary proceedings as if it had been committed in Singapore.\nClause 23 amends section 115(2) \u2014\n(a) by deleting paragraphs (i) and (q) relating to regulations for the control of lighting, which amendment is related to the deletion of section 4(2)(l) by clause 3(b); and\n(b) by amending paragraph (o) such that regulations may be made to provide, if necessary, for the equipping of members of the public for the purposes of civil defence, which amendment is related to the amendment of the current section 4(2)(d) (renumbered section 4(2)(c)) by clause 3(b).\nClause 24 contains a saving and transitional provision.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The present penalty is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both. Clause 7 raises the penalty for a first offence under section 144(1) to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nHowever, where the accused is a repeat offender, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $150,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.\nA person is a repeat offender if the person, being accused of an offence under section 144(1), has been previously convicted or found guilty on at least one other earlier occasion of an offence under section 144(1).

As amended, where the offence is committed by a person outside\nSingapore, the person may be dealt with in respect of that offence by our courts as if it had been committed in Singapore.\nHowever, the remote communication service has to have a Singapore link.\nA remote communication service has a Singapore link if any person physically present in Singapore is capable of having access to any matter communicated using the remote communication service.\nWhere a person is charged with an offence under section 146A(1), it is a defence for the person charged to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the person did not know, and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained, that the remote communication service in question had a Singapore link.\nClause 10 also raises the penalty in section 146A(1).

The accused may have been previously convicted or (if a juvenile) found guilty of the offence under section 146A(1) before, on or after the date of commencement of clause 10.\nClause 11 amends section 147 containing offences related to places of assignation.\nThe present penalty for the offence under section 147(1) (keeping, managing or assisting in the management of a place of assignation) is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. Clause 11 raises the penalty for a first offence under section 147(1) to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nHowever, where the accused is a repeat offender, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $150,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.\nClause 11 also raises the penalty for the offence under section 147(2) (keeping, managing or assisting in the management of a club or a place of public resort which is used as a place of assignation). The present penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, is a fine not exceeding $15,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.\nThe penalty is changed to mandatory imprisonment for a term not exceeding\n7 years and liability to a fine not exceeding $100,000.\nHowever, where the accused is a repeat offender, the penalty is mandatory imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and liability to a fine not exceeding $150,000.\nA person is a repeat offender if the person, being accused of an offence under section 147, has been previously convicted or found guilty on at least one other earlier occasion of an offence under section 147. The accused may have been previously convicted or (if a juvenile) found guilty of the offence under section 147 before, on or after the date of commencement of clause 11.\nClause 12 amends the mental elements and penalties for the offences under section 148 relating to brothels.\nUnder section 148(2) today, a person who is the tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge of any place which is used as a brothel commits the offence under section 148 unless the person proves that he or she has no knowledge that the place is used as a brothel. The amendment requires additional proof on the part of the tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge before he or she can avoid criminal liability. The tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge has to prove that he or she\nhas no knowledge that the place is used as a brothel, and must also prove that he or she could not, with reasonable diligence, have ascertained that the place is used as a brothel.\nUse as a brothel would, by reason of the amended definition of \"brothel\", include use as premises advertised or represented as being used for the purpose of prostitution.\nA similar amendment is made to section 148(3) which deals with tenanted places which are in turn let or sub-let. Section 148(3) states that the tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge of any place who lets the place or any part thereof still commits an offence despite the letting, unless the person proves that he or she has no knowledge that the place or part thereof is used as a brothel. The amendment requires additional proof on the part of the tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge before he or she can avoid criminal liability. The tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge has to prove that at the time of entering into the letting (such as by tenancy agreement or parting with possession) he or she had no knowledge that the place or part thereof is to be used as a brothel, and must also prove that he or she could not, with reasonable diligence, have ascertained that the place or part thereof is to be used as a brothel.\nClause 12 also amends section 148(4) regarding the offence where a person who is the owner of any place, or the agent of that owner, lets a place which is used as a brothel. Today, criminal liability arises for the owner of the place, or the agent of that owner, who lets the place or any part of the place which is used as a brothel if the owner or agent has let the place or part thereof with the knowledge that the place or part thereof is to be used as a brothel, or the owner or agent is wilfully a party to the continued use of the place or any part thereof as a brothel.\nUnder the amended section 148(4), knowledge and wilful participation are no longer elements of the offence. The owner or agent of the owner of a place who lets the place or any part of the place commits an offence under section 148(4), despite the letting, if the place or part thereof is used as a brothel. But the owner or agent of such an owner can avoid criminal liability if he or she can show that the owner or agent (as the case may be) at the time of entering into the letting (such as by tenancy agreement or parting with possession) did not know and could not, with reasonable diligence, have ascertained that the place or part thereof is to be used as a brothel.\nFinally, the penalties for offences under section 148 are also raised. The present penalty is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding\n3 years or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent offence, is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nClause 12 raises the penalty for a first offence under section 148 to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nHowever, where the accused is a repeat offender, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $150,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.\nA person is a repeat offender if the person, being accused of an offence under section 148, has been previously convicted or found guilty on at least one other earlier occasion of an offence under section 148, regardless of the subsection. The accused may have been previously convicted or (if a juvenile) found guilty of the offence under section 148 before, on or after the date of commencement of clause 12.\nClauses 13, 14 and 15 amend sections 150, 151 and 174(1), respectively, in respect of the cross-references to sections affected by the amendments in clauses 5 to 12.\nClause 15 also amends section 174(1) to extend the power of arrest by the\nDirector of Social Welfare, or any public officer (being either a police officer not below the rank of sergeant, an immigration officer within the meaning of the\nImmigration Act (Cap. 133) or a public officer) to an offence under section 146A.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

No. S 226/2015) for riding, driving or moving a motor vehicle, between 5.30 p.m.\nand 7.00 p.m. on any weekday between 4 May 2015 and 22 September 2015\n(both dates inclusive), into any of the following specified entry points on the Ayer Rajah Expressway:\n(i) on the slip road from Clementi Avenue 6 into the\nAyer\nRajah\nExpressway on the eastbound\ncarriageway;\n(ii) on the slip road from Clementi Avenue 2 into the\nAyer\nRajah\nExpressway on the eastbound carriageway;\n(iii) between the slip road into the\nAyer\nRajah\nExpressway from Jurong Town Hall Road and the slip road into Clementi Avenue 6 from the Ayer Rajah\nExpressway on the Ayer Rajah Expressway on the eastbound carriageway;\n(f) as administrative charges under rule 7(2) of the Road\nTraffic (Electronic Road Pricing System) Rules 2015 and as composition sums, between 4 May 2015 and 13 August 2015 (both dates inclusive), from any person for riding, driving or moving a motor vehicle into any of the specified entry points on the Ayer Rajah Expressway during the dates\nand times mentioned in paragraph (e).\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), every sum mentioned in subsection (1) is, and is taken always to have been, by force of this section, validly imposed and collected under the principal Act; and no legal proceedings may be instituted on or after 10 January 2017 in any\ncourt on account of or in respect of any such collection.\n(3) However, nothing in subsection (2) applies to, or may be construed to affect \u2014\n(a) any decision or judgment or warrant issued by any court given before 10 January 2017; or\n(b) any proceedings before any court commenced before\n10 January 2017, in relation to the liability of any person to pay any sum mentioned in subsection (1)(a), (b), (c), (d) or (f), or the criminal liability of any person for riding, driving or moving a motor vehicle, between\n5.30 p.m. and 7.00p.m. on any weekday between 4 May 2015 and\n22 September 2015 (both dates inclusive), into any specified entry point on the Ayer Rajah Expressway mentioned in subsection (1)(e).\n(4) All sums mentioned in subsection (1) must be paid into the\nConsolidated Fund.\nRelated amendments to Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and\nCompensation) Act\n45. The Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and Compensation)\nAct (Cap. 189) is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting subsection (6) of section 3; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after section 3, the following section:\n\"Presumption as to using motor vehicle 3A.\u2014(1) For the purposes of this Act, it is\npresumed, until the contrary is proved, that a person uses a motor vehicle on a road in Singapore if it is proved \u2014\n(a) for a vehicle registered under the Road\nTraffic Act (Cap. 276), that the person is, at\nthe material time, recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles;\n(b) for a vehicle the registration of which under the Road Traffic Act is cancelled under section 27(1) of that Act or has lapsed, that\nthe person is last recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles; or\n(c) for a vehicle that is not registered under the\nRoad Traffic Act and is not a vehicle mentioned in paragraph (b), that the\nperson has a legal right to possession of the vehicle (including any person who has the use of the vehicle under a lease or hire\u2010purchase agreement, but not the lessor\nwhile the vehicle is being leased under any such agreement).\n(2) In subsection (1), \"register of vehicles\" means the register required by rules made under section 34 of\nthe Road Traffic Act to be maintained by the Authority for the purposes of section 10 of that Act.\".\nSaving and transitional provisions 46.\u2014(1) Despite section 4, the classes of vehicles in force on the eve of the date of commencement of that section continue to have effect\nfor the purposes of the principal Act until an order is made after that date under the principal Act as amended by this Act.\n(2) Section 16(b) does not apply to a person who commits an offence under section 29(1) or (2) of the principal Act before the date of commencement of section 16(b).\n(3) Despite sections 22 and 23, any breath alcohol analyser that is, on the date of commencement of those sections, prescribed for the purposes of sections 70 and 71A of the principal Act is, from that date, taken to be a type of breath analysing device approved by the Deputy\nCommissioner of Police for a breath test under the principal Act, until\nthe Deputy Commissioner of Police disapproves of that type under the principal Act as amended by this Act.\n(4) Section 45(a) does not apply to a person who commits an offence under section 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and\nCompensation) Act (Cap. 189) before the date of commencement of\nsection 45(a).\n(5) For a period of 2 years \u2014\n(a) after the date of commencement of section 19, 21, 22, 23,\n24 or 26 of this Act, the Minister charged with the responsibility for law and order may, by regulations,\nprescribe such additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of that section as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient; or\n(b) after the date of commencement of any other section of this\nAct, the Minister charged with the responsibility for land transport may, by regulations, prescribe such additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on\nthe enactment of that section as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) for the following main objectives:\n(a) to establish a regulatory framework for the undertaking of trials and use on Singapore roads of autonomous motor vehicles (also commonly known as driverless vehicles);\n(b) to regulate holders of vocational licences who are affiliated drivers of private hire car booking service operators providing ride\u2010sourcing services in Singapore;\n(c) to support the move towards paperless vehicle licences;\n(d) to validate the collection of certain sums which would have been valid if the law had been in force.\nThe Bill also makes related amendments to the Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party\nRisks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nAs the different subject matters in the Road Traffic Act fall within the portfolios of the Minister charged with the responsibility for land transport and the Minister charged with the responsibility for law and order, respectively, clause 1 provides for the different provisions in the Bill to be brought into force by the Minister charged with the responsibility for land transport.\nThe amendment to the long title (in clause 2) is deemed to have come into operation on 22 January 2016, which is the operative date of the Bus Services\nIndustry Act 2015 (Act 30 of 2015).\nClause 2 amends the long title to omit references to the operation of bus interchanges, since that has been transferred to the Bus Services Industry Act 2015.\nClause 3 amends various definitions in section 2(1).\nThe definition of \"motor vehicle\" is replaced with one that is more technology neutral. It is no longer confined to a motor\u2010powered vehicle with wheels and for the\nmotor to form part of the vehicle. The definition still refers to a vehicle that is used or intended to be used on a road.\nAn \"autonomous motor vehicle\" is defined to mean a motor vehicle equipped wholly or substantially with an autonomous system (also commonly known as a driverless vehicle) and includes a trailer drawn by such a motor vehicle. For example, a motor vehicle is not equipped with an autonomous system only because it has a system for collision avoidance, electronic blind spot assistance, automated emergency braking, park assist, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, or lane departure warning.\nA new definition of \"automated vehicle technology\" is introduced to support the amendments on driverless vehicles. A particular technology is \"automated vehicle technology\" for the purposes of the Act if it relates to the design, construction or use of autonomous motor vehicles, or otherwise relates to advances in the design or construction of such driverless motor vehicles.\nThe definition of \"Deputy Commissioner of Police\" is also updated to take into account that more than one Deputy Commissioner of Police can be appointed under the Police Force Act (Cap. 235), and to include a police officer not below the rank of sergeant who is authorised by a Deputy Commissioner of Police concerned to exercise the powers of that Deputy Commissioner of Police.\nThe definition of \"Minister\" is also amended to match the portfolio descriptions for the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Home Affairs, instead of using their title.\nClause 4 deletes and substitutes section 4(1) and (2) to render the basic legislative framework for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles better able to respond to and address challenges presented by rapidly changing automotive technologies.\nMotor vehicles are today classified according to categories outlined in section 4(1). An amendment must be made by Parliament whenever there is a need to adjust the description or introduce a new class or abolish a class. However, automotive technologies are changing rapidly. For example, micro cars and other lightweight vehicles designed to carry only passengers do not fit in well in the class now described as \"motor cars\" in section 4(1)(e). Subdivisions of any of the classes of motor vehicles in section 4(1) are also required to be set out in another instrument viz. by way of an order under section 4(2) made by the Land Transport\nAuthority of Singapore (LTA).\nBy the amendment in clause 4, the classes of motor vehicles will no longer be prescribed in the Act itself but set out in an order published in the Gazette. This order is to be made by the LTAwith the approval of the Minister. This will facilitate quicker updating to cope with rapidly changing automotive technologies.\nSubdivisions of these classes (which like today may be according to weight, construction, nature of tyres, use or otherwise) are also to be described in the same\norder, instead of a separate instrument. As the information about the classes and subdivisions of motor vehicles are fundamental to the registration and licensing of motor vehicles in the Act, the order is required to be presented to Parliament when made, and every time it is subsequently amended.\nClause 5 amends section 5 to make it clear that an authorisation Notification under section 5(2) does not extend to authorising use of driverless vehicles. The latter is the subject of a regulatory framework specially set out in new sections 6C, 6D and 6E inserted by clause 6.\nClause 5 also amends the offence in section 5(5) on altering of vehicles. It provides that a person who alters or offers to alter (whether in the course of repair or otherwise) a vehicle or trailer so as to render its condition such that the use of the vehicle or trailer on any road in that condition is unlawful under section 5(1), is guilty of an offence.\nThe alteration or offer to alter need not be in the course of business. The vehicle or trailer altered need not belong to another person. The offence may even be committed by an individual altering his or her own vehicle for his or her own use on the road.\nSection 5 is further amended to introduce a rebuttable presumption as to when a person alters (whether in the course of repair or otherwise) a vehicle or trailer as to render its condition such that its use in that condition would be unlawful by virtue of section 5 (called non\u2010compliant). The presumption arises if it is proved that the accused had possession of the vehicle or trailer, that the vehicle or trailer was not non\u2010compliant when the accused acquired possession of it, and that at that time or soon after the vehicle or trailer (as the case may be) ceased to be in the accused's possession, the vehicle or trailer is non\u2010compliant.\nFinally, the punishment for the offences in section 5(5) or (6) is also raised to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. The punishment is thus aligned with that for similar offences in Part 4 of the Active\nMobility Act 2017 regarding personal mobility devices and other vehicles used on public paths.\nClause 6 inserts 3 new sections relating to trials involving, and use of, autonomous motor vehicles and automated vehicle technology so that experimental autonomous motor vehicles remain clearly subject to the motor vehicle liability scheme under the Act.\nThe new section 6C empowers the Minister to make rules for the LTA to regulate the undertaking of any trial on any road of autonomous motor vehicles or automated vehicle technology (called an approved trial), and the use on a road of any wholly or substantially autonomous motor vehicle operated with automated vehicle technology (called an approved special use). This will be despite section 5.\nTrials or use of autonomous motor vehicles or automated vehicle technologies other than on roads (such as in laboratories) are not covered by the new sections 6C, 6D and 6E.\nThe rules made under the new section 6C may limit the period that an approved trial or approved special use may be undertaken or carried out. The rules require the person authorised under the rules to undertake the approved trial or carry out the approved special use (called the specified person) to have in place before the approved trial or approved special use starts, and to ensure that there is in force at all times during the period of the approved trial or approved special use, liability insurance, or in lieu of such insurance, a deposit or other security not lower than the prescribed amount in the rules to be provided to the LTA.\nThe rules may also require the specified person to cause to be published (at the person's cost), before the approved trial or approved special use starts, a notice about the approved trial or approved special use, in a manner as will secure adequate publicity for the approved trial or approved special use, including the area or areas of Singapore in which the approved trial or approved special use may be undertaken or carried out, and the period of the approved trial or approved special\nuse.\nThe rules may also deal with the use of the vehicles or trailers in the approved trial or approved special use, and their construction, design and equipment, for the safety of road users or for public safety or both, as well as the weather and any climatic or other circumstances when an approved trial or approved special use may or may not be undertaken or carried out. There may also be requirements for the keeping of records by the specified person (such as sensor data and video footage), and the giving of information to the LTA or any other person designated by the LTA, about the approved trial or approved special use undertaken or participated in, including the automated vehicle technology involved in the trial or special use.\nThe new section 6D further allows these rules for the purpose of an approved trial or approved special use, to exempt (with or without conditions) from the application of section 5 or other specified provisions of the Act or its subsidiary legislation, any of the following:\n(a) the specified person authorised to undertake the approved trial or carry out the approved special use;\n(b) any other person or class of persons participating in the conduct of the approved trial or approved special use;\n(c) any vehicle or trailer used in the approved trial or approved special use.\nThe rules may also modify the application of specified provisions of the Act or its subsidiary legislation in respect of any of the same category of persons.\nThis is because many provisions in the Act presently governing the use of roads contain instructions for how vehicles should be driven on the road and provide for observing road signage by drivers. The underlying assumption is that there is a driver controlling the vehicle. However, this would be negated in wholly driverless cars, or those substantially outfitted with automated vehicle technologies such that the vehicle's occupant is not expected to actively monitor the vehicle's behaviour or performance.\nInstead of having a situation where these provisions in the Act or its subsidiary legislation about persons driving become superseded in the case of autonomous motor vehicles, or of having to disapply these laws entirely through the blunt instrument of an exemption order under section 142, the new section 6D allows for these provisions in the Act or its subsidiary legislation to be modified. Doing so ensures that experimental autonomous motor vehicles remain subject to these provisions in the Act or its subsidiary legislation and the criminal motor vehicle liability scheme under those provisions.\nHowever, rules made under section 6C cannot modify the application of other\nActs or their subsidiary legislation, even if these assume the existence of a driver, such as section 20 of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap. 95) and regulation 19 of the Environmental Protection and Management (Vehicular\nEmissions) Regulations (Cap. 94A, Rg 6).\nAs the facility to modify the Act is a deviation from the principle that only an Act of Parliament can amend an Act of Parliament, there is a \"sunset\" arrangement for these rules made under section 6C. They continue in force only for a period of\n5 years starting on the date of commencement of clause 6 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 when it is enacted. The new sections 6C and 6D and rules thereunder will lapse at the end of the 5 years unless the Act is amended to extend that period.\nThe new section 6E makes it an offence if a person, without reasonable excuse, hinders or obstructs an approved trial or the carrying out of an approved special use, or interferes with any equipment or device in an autonomous motor vehicle, or relating to any automated vehicle technology, used in an approved trial or approved special use. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000.\nFor example, curious bystanders may deliberately throw objects or walk in front of autonomous motor vehicles that are on trial, so as to test the reaction of the vehicle's sensors.\nThere is, however, a defence for a defendant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that the activity that caused the hindrance, obstruction or interference would cause the hindrance, obstruction or interference, as the case may be.\nThe provision does not affect the operation of the Computer Misuse and\nCybersecurity Act (Cap. 50A), which contains offences on unauthorised use or interception of a computer service and hacking that carry a heavier penalty.\nClause 7 amends section 9(4) to support the move away from paper licences.\nThe duty of the Registrar of Vehicles (the Registrar) is changed from causing to be printed and provided forms of licences and applications for such licences, to making publicly available these licences and application forms.\nClause 8 amends section 10(3) by changing the punishment for the offence of keeping or using an unregistered vehicle on a road. The amendment will allow a court to impose both a fine and custodial sentence.\nClause 9 introduces a new section 11B which imposes liability for the additional registration fee for vehicles exempted from the requirement of payment of a levy and permit under section 10A when the basis for the exemption ends.\nThe new section applies where an exemption is granted under section 14, 33 or\n142 (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of clause 9) from the requirement of a permit (commonly called a certificate of entitlement) or levy under section 10A in respect of a vehicle first registered on or after 1 April 1998 and before 26 February 2013. The exemption may be subject to conditions, such as for a specified period, or based on the use of the vehicle or the status of the registered vehicle owner.\nAn example of such an exemption is that granted to school buses, a vehicle used for firefighting purposes, or a vehicle registered in the name of a diplomatic agent, consular officer, an international organisation or a disabled person.\nWhen the condition of the exemption is breached or when the basis for the exemption ends, etc., the tax that would have been payable under section 11(1)(a) (commonly called the additional registration fee or ARF) when the vehicle was first registered, will be recoverable from the person keeping or using the vehicle at the time of the breach or when the basis for the exemption ends. The ARF would be the amount payable at the rates when the vehicle was first registered as if it was first registered with a permit issued on the first registration date, and includes any rebate that was claimable at that time.\nAny person who gives any incorrect information in relation to any matter affecting the amount of tax chargeable under the new section 11B faces criminal prosecution and punishment on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. In addition, the court is to order the offender to pay to the Registrar the amount of tax undercharged.\nClause 10 repeals section 12. This abolishes the exception for citizens of\nSingapore, residents of Singapore or a holder of a work pass under the\nEmployment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap. 91A) to keep or use a vehicle not\nregistered under the Act but in respect of which a licence issued under the law of any country other than Singapore is in force.\nClause 11 repeals and re\u2010enacts section 16 regarding the presumption on the use and keeping of vehicles.\nThe new section 16 sets out a rebuttable presumption for the purposes of Part I and relies on the register required by rules made under section 34 to be maintained by the LTA for the purposes of section 10.\nThe new section 16 provides that for a vehicle registered under the Act, the person who is, at the material time, recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles, is presumed to be the person who keeps or uses the vehicle on a road in Singapore.\nFor a vehicle the registration of which under this Act is cancelled under section 27(1) or has lapsed, the person presumed to keep or use the vehicle on a road in Singapore is the person last recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles.\nIn any other case, the person presumed to keep or use the vehicle on a road in\nSingapore is the person who has a legal right to possession of the vehicle (including any person who has the use of the vehicle under a lease or hire\u2010purchase agreement, but not the lessor while the vehicle is being leased under any such agreement).\nClause 12 amends section 24(2) to render the text technology neutral, to facilitate the introduction of paperless licences.\nClause 13 amends section 25 to expand the power to make rules to empower the\nRegistrar to turn back foreign vehicles being driven into or from Singapore. The power can now extend to foreign vehicles where there is unpaid any charge, fee or tax payable in respect of that vehicle under the Act or the Parking Places\nAct (Cap. 214) or any of their respective subsidiary legislation.\nClause 13 also amends section 25 to exclude citizens and permanent residents of\nSingapore from the scope of the term \"person resident outside Singapore\" in section 25. By this amendment, rules made under section 25 do not extend to citizens and permanent residents of Singapore who intend to bring foreign motor vehicles into Singapore from a place outside Singapore.\nClause 14 amends section 27(1) by introducing a new circumstance in which the\nRegistrar may cancel the registration of a vehicle. This is where the Registrar becomes aware of a circumstance that would have required or permitted the\nRegistrar to refuse to register the vehicle, had the Registrar been aware of the circumstance immediately before registering the vehicle.\nClause 15 amends section 28A to exclude special purpose licences being issued in respect of autonomous motor vehicles that are the subject of an approved trial or approved special use under the new sections 6C and 6D. The rules that may be\nmade under those sections can provide for the licensing of these approved trials and approved special uses.\nSection 28A is further amended to require a person to whom a special purpose licence is issued to take certain actions, within one month after the licence is cancelled or lapses, in relation to the vehicle in respect of which the special purpose licence was issued. These actions are to register the vehicle, remove the vehicle from use on all roads in Singapore and give the LTA adequate proof of that, or to destroy or export the vehicle and give the LTA adequate proof of that. This is an obligation similarly imposed under section 27(2) with regard to deregistered vehicles.\nFailure to comply with this new offence in section 28A carries a similar penalty as that in section 27(3), which is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.\nClause 16 amends section 29 to raise the punishment for an offence under section 29(1).\nThe time\u2010bar (of 12 months) in section 29(3) against prosecution for an offence under section 29(1) or (2) is also abolished by clause 16.\nHowever, the abolition of the time\u2010bar does not apply to persons who commit the offence before the date of commencement of clause 16. Hence, a prosecution cannot be instituted for an offence under section 29(1) or (2) more than 12 months after it is committed, if committed before the date of commencement of clause 16 and even though on the eve of that commencement, the defendant was not already entitled to the benefit of the time\u2010bar. See clause 46 for details.\nClause 17 amends section 34(1)(g) to require information contained in any records maintained by the Registrar with respect to licensing of vehicles to be made publicly available, in addition to information about the marking, registration or keeping of vehicles. Information about licensing of vehicles is already accessible online at LTA's official website. This does not prohibit the charging of a fee for the provision of information.\nClause 18 amends section 34D(1) to confer the power to make rules that empower the Registrar to turn back foreign vehicles being driven into or from\nSingapore where there are unpaid road\u2010user charges.\nClause 19 amends section 36 (on provisional driving licences) to remove the fixed validity period of 6 months in section 36(3). By this amendment, the validity period of a provisional driving licence is to be set out in rules made under section 48. Different validity periods for provisional driving licences may be prescribed in rules under section 48 for different types of provisional driving licences.\nClause 20 amends section 64(1) to raise the fines for the offence of reckless or dangerous driving.\nClause 21 amends section 69 to make it clear that the breath test under the section is a preliminary breath test using a device of a type that is different from that used for the purposes of section 70. A corresponding amendment is made to section 70.\nClauses 22 and 23 amend sections 70 and 71A, respectively, to omit references to a prescribed breath alcohol analyser. This is replaced by a breath analysing device that is of a type approved by a Deputy Commissioner of Police for breath tests under section 70.\nClause 24 amends the definition of \"breath test\" in section 72 to refer to a test of a specimen of a person's breath to assess whether there is alcohol present in the person's breath, and if alcohol is present, the concentration of alcohol in the person's breath, and for the test to be carried out by means of a breath analysing device of a type approved by a Deputy Commissioner of Police.\nThe other amendments are a consequence of the omission of references to a breath alcohol analyser that has to be prescribed by rules before it can be used for the purposes of detection and enforcement against drink driving cases.\nClause 25 amends section 81 regarding the punishment for the owner of a motor vehicle who, when required by a police officer or an LTA employee to do so, fails to provide the identity and address of the person who was driving the motor vehicle at or about the time of an alleged offence and the driving licence held by that person.\nThe punishment for failing to do so is changed to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.\nThe penalty for wilfully or recklessly furnishing any false or misleading information when so reporting is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\nClause 26 introduces a new section 82, which confers power on the Minister charged with the responsibility for law and order to amend the Third Schedule.\nClause 27 amends the punishment in section 84(8) for the offence for breaching the vehicle driver's duty to report an accident occurring if, owing to the presence of the vehicle on a road an accident occurs whereby any individual is injured or any property (including any animal) is damaged or destroyed. The amendment will allow a court to impose both a fine and custodial sentence.\nClause 28 amends section 87(1) to support the move away towards paperless licences.\nClause 29 amends section 90 regarding examination of motor vehicles to comply with the prescribed requirements relating to its construction and condition, to the identification marks and signs carried by or fixed on it, etc., and for the purpose of issuing a test certificate. The amendment allows the examiner to accept, in lieu of an examination, any certificate that is issued by another person or authority prescribed. That certificate must relate to the prescribed requirements relating to the construction and condition of the motor vehicle, to the identification marks and signs carried by or fixed on the motor vehicle and the seals of such marks and signs, and to the markings on the motor vehicle.\nClause 30 introduces a new section 95B that confers on the LTA to make an order for the forfeiture, or an order for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture, if it is satisfied that the vehicle is a non\u2010compliant power\u2010assisted bicycle or a non\u2010compliant personal mobility device, an offence under section 5 or 10, the new sections 5A and 5B or any rules made under section 6 has been committed and that the vehicle was the subject matter, or was used in the commission, of the offence, and a person is convicted of the offence, or a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence has that offence compounded under section 135.\nClause 31 amends section 101 on the offence of unauthorised use, or causing or permitting to be used, a motor vehicle as a public service vehicle when it is not a licensed public service vehicle. The amendment provides the circumstances when a motor vehicle is regarded as being used as a private hire car.\nOne situation is where the motor vehicle is in use in connection with a hiring to provide a ride\u2010sourcing service as defined by the new section 110A inserted by clause 34.\nAnother situation is where the motor vehicle is immediately available to a private hire car booking service operator (within the meaning of the new section 110A) to accept bookings from passengers for a ride\u2010sourcing service using that vehicle.\nClause 32 amends section 105(1) to remove the requirement that every public service vehicle that is licensed must have permanently affixed to it plates or markings. With the amendments, these plates and markings may be removable, include such as decalomanias and adhesive stickers.\nClause 33 amends section 110(3) to make it clear that a vocational licence to drive a public service vehicle may be limited to one or more classes of public service vehicle specified in the licence. This will allow the Registrar to issue vocational licences to individuals to drive, for example, both taxis and private hire cars.\nNext, section 110(4) is amended to expand the grounds under which a vocational licence may be suspended or revoked. The new ground is where the holder of the vocational licence is contravening or not complying with, or has contravened or failed to comply with any of the conditions of the licence, or any provision of the\nAct or rules under Part V applicable to the holder of the vocational licence as a licence holder.\nSection 110(4) is also amended to enable the Registrar to revoke or suspend a vocational licence wholly or in part. For example, where a vocational licence authorises an individual to drive both a taxi and a private hire car, the amendments will allow the Registrar to revoke or suspend the licence that authorises an individual to drive both a taxi and a private hire car, or partly such that the individual may remain authorised to drive either a taxi or a private hire car, as the case may be.\nClause 34 introduces new sections 110A and 110B that confer power on the\nRegistrar to issue a general suspension order directing that every bookable vehicle driver who is an affiliated driver of the same private hire car booking service operator stop providing, during a blackout period, ride\u2010sourcing services booked through that private hire car booking service operator.\nAn affiliated driver of a private hire car booking service who continues to provide a ride\u2010sourcing service through bookings by that private hire car booking service operator during that blackout period, will be guilty of an offence. It is not a defence that the accused then had in force a vocational licence granted under section 110 authorising the accused to drive a public service vehicle.\nThe blackout period, for a general suspension order, is defined in the new section 110B to mean a period after the general suspension order takes effect that is of a duration fixed and specified by the Registrar in the order, being a period not exceeding one month.\nThe Registrar can issue a general suspension order if the Registrar is satisfied that one of the affiliated drivers has been convicted of a relevant offence as an affiliated driver of the private hire car booking service operator, and within a period of 12 months before that conviction, 2 or more other affiliated drivers of the same private hire car booking service operator have also been convicted of a relevant offence each as an affiliated driver of that private hire car booking service operator.\nA relevant offence is defined in the new section 110B to mean any one of the following offences committed on or after the date of commencement of clause 34:\n(a) an offence under section 101(2), which is the unauthorised use, or causing or permitting to be used, a motor vehicle as a public service vehicle when it is not a licensed public service vehicle;\n(b) an offence under section 131 for contravening section 110(1)(a), which is driving or acting as a conductor of a public service vehicle on a road without a vocational licence for that purpose;\n(c) an offence under section 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and Compensation) Act in relation to any private hire car.\nThe new section 110A further provides the method by which relevant offences are counted, and this can include offences that are compounded.\nA private hire car booking service operator is defined in the new section 110B to mean a person who, in the course of business, accepts bookings from people for a ride\u2010sourcing service and communicates the bookings to bookable vehicle drivers to carry out that service.\nFor example, luxury vehicle rental companies where bookings ordinarily come with a driver provided, and businesses providing vehicles for hire for specific purposes, like a wedding, a funeral or a tour.\nThe definition would include any such conduct outside Singapore, or partly inside and partly outside Singapore. This will extend to cover popular ride\u2010sourcing platforms like Uber and Grab.\nA private hire car booking service operator is however defined in the new section 110B to exclude a taxi service operator and a provider of a third\u2010party taxi booking service within the meaning of the Third\u2010Party Taxi Booking Service\nProviders Act 2015 (Act 17 of 2015) and who is registered as such under that Act, since these services are already regulated under other provisions of statute.\nClause 35 amends the rule\u2010making power conferred on the LTA under section 111 regarding public service vehicles, so as to better deal with ride\u2010sourcing services provided by private hire car booking services. Express power is conferred to make rules about the responsibilities and duties of a private hire car booking service operator. This can include a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that each affiliated driver either holds a vocational licence that authorises the driver to drive the bookable vehicle, or that is exempted under the Act from holding such a licence.\nClause 36 amends section 122 to prescribe a specific punishment for the offence of causing or permitting a vehicle or any trailer drawn thereby to remain at rest on any road in such a position or in such condition or in such circumstances as to be likely to cause danger, obstruction or undue inconvenience to other users of the road or to traffic. The punishment is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.\nClause 37 amends section 131 by changing the punishment for the general offence of contravening any provision of the Act or its rules. The amendment will allow a court to impose both a fine and custodial sentence.\nClause 38 amends section 135 on compounding of offences. The amendment raises the maximum composition sum from $500 to either one half of the amount of the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence or $5,000, whichever is the lower.\nClause 38 also provides that offers of composition may be made by certain officials, called \"relevant officers\". They are the Deputy Commissioner of Police designated by the Commissioner of Police for this purpose, a police officer not below the rank of sergeant specially authorised by name by that Deputy\nCommissioner of Police, the Registrar, or an LTA employee specially authorised (by name) personally executed by the Registrar. The amendments will not prevent the present practice of publishing the names of authorised LTA officers or police officers in a notification in the Gazette.\nClause 39 amends section 136 to better support the move towards paperless licences.\nClause 40 introduces a new section 140A to provide that any subsidiary legislation made under the Act can incorporate some or all of another document without having to reproduce the text of that document as part of the rule. This means that the content of the document becomes part of the law.\nAs it is a fundamental principle of the rule of law that people must be able to understand their rights and obligations at law, in order to ensure readily accessible law, clause 40 limits the incorporation to circumstances where the documents being incorporated are publicly available for free or at a minimal cost. The maker of the subsidiary legislation is required to give notice in the Gazette stating the material that is incorporated in the subsidiary legislation and the date on which the relevant provision in the subsidiary legislation was made, and where the material can be inspected during working hours, free of charge or if copies of the material are available in other ways, the details of where or how the material can be accessed or obtained.\nClause 41 amends the definition of a private hire car in the Second Schedule to make explicit that private hire cars can consist of 2 types; those that are hired or made available for hiring for self\u2010driving, and those the hire of which comes with a driver.\nClause 42 amends the Third Schedule as a consequence of the revocation of rule 34 of the Road Traffic Rules (Cap. 276, R 20) on 1 February 2015 and the re\u2010enacted\nRoad\nTraffic (Electronic\nRoad\nPricing\nSystem)\nRules 2015 (G.N. No. S 226/2015).\nClause 43 makes amendments to various sections in the Act to rectify an error during the law revision process that deleted references to rules made under the Act.\nClause 44 validates the collection of certain ARF, additional licence fees, road\u2010user charges, composition sums and administrative fees that would have been valid if the relevant legislative amendments had been in force.\nClause 45 makes 2 related amendments to the Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and Compensation) Act.\nFirst, the time\u2010bar in section 3(6) for instituting a prosecution for an offence under the section is abolished.\nHowever, the abolition of the time\u2010bar does not apply to persons who commit the offence before the date of commencement of clause 45(a). Hence, a prosecution cannot be instituted for an offence under section 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third\u2010Party Risks and Compensation) Act more than 6 months after it is committed if committed before the date of commencement of clause 45(a), even though on the eve of that commencement, the defendant was not already entitled to the benefit of the time\u2010bar. See clause 46.\nSecond, a new rebuttable presumption regarding the use of vehicles is introduced by clause 45, similar to the amendments in clause 11. The new section 3A sets out a rebuttable presumption that relies on the register required by rules made under section 34 of the Road Traffic Act to be maintained by the LTA for the purposes of section 10 of that Act.\nThe new section 3A provides that for a vehicle registered under the Road Traffic\nAct, the person who is, at the material time, recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles, is presumed to be the person who keeps or uses the vehicle on a road in Singapore. For a vehicle the registration of which under the Road Traffic\nAct is cancelled under section 27(1) of that Act or has lapsed, the person presumed to keep or use the vehicle on a road in Singapore is the person last recorded as the owner of that vehicle in a register of vehicles.\nIn any other case, the person presumed to keep or use the vehicle on a road in\nSingapore is the person who has a legal right to possession of the vehicle (including any person who has the use of the vehicle under a lease or hire\u2010purchase agreement, but not the lessor while the vehicle is being leased under any such agreement).\nClause 46 is a saving and transitional provision. It further confers on the relevant\nMinister a power to make regulations of a saving or transitional nature, in the\n2 years after the date of commencement of the relevant provision in the Bill.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

or\n(c) the Chief Inspector of Accidents or an Inspector for investigation into accidents,\nshall continue in such respective office as if he were appointed under the corresponding provisions of the principal Act as amended by this\nAct, and their respective appointments shall expire on the date they would have expired if this Act had not been enacted.\n(4) Any application or other document lodged for approval under\nthe provisions of the principal Act and any subsidiary legislation made under the principal Act and is pending immediately before the date of commencement of this Act shall, where applicable, be deemed to be an application or a document lodged for approval under the corresponding provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act.\n(5) For a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of this section, the Minister may, by regulations, prescribe such additional provisions of a savings or transitional nature consequent on the enactment of this section as he may consider necessary or expedient.\n(6) Except as expressly provided in this section, this section shall\napply without prejudice to section 16 of the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1).\nConsequential amendments to Civil Aviation Authority of\nSingapore Act 2009 21.\u2014(1) Section 7(1) of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\nAct 2009 (Act 17 of 2009) is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting the words \"the provision of air services,\" in paragraph (b); and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after paragraph (g), the following paragraph:\n\"(ga) to cooperate with the Air Accident Investigation\nBureau of Singapore in relation to investigations under Part IIA of the Air Navigation Act (Cap. 6);\".\n(2) The Second Schedule to the Civil Aviation Authority of\nSingapore Act 2009 is amended \u2014\n(a) by inserting, immediately after the word \"concurrence\" in paragraph 3, the words \", aviation safety instrument\";\n(b) by inserting, immediately after paragraph 3, the following paragraphs:\n\"3A. To develop and issue appropriate, clear and concise aviation\nsafety standards, codes, rules, requirements, specifications or other documents for the purpose of providing practical guidance or certainty to, or otherwise relating to \u2014\n(a) the flight crew engaged in operations of aircraft;\n(b) the design, construction, maintenance, operation and use of\naircraft and related equipment;\n(c) the planning, construction, establishment, operation and use of aerodromes;\n(d) the establishment and use of airspace;\n(e) the regulation of air navigation services;\n(f) the personnel engaged in the maintenance of aircraft and related equipment; or\n(g) any matter that is the subject of any order or regulations under the Air Navigation Act,\nand to develop effective enforcement strategies to secure compliance with those aviation safety standards, codes or specifications.\n3B. To conduct regular reviews of the system of civil aviation\nsafety in order to monitor the safety performance of the aviation industry, to identify safety-related trends and risk factors and to conduct regular and timely assessment of international safety developments.\n3C. To conduct comprehensive safety education and training\nprogrammes and provide accurate and timely aviation safety advice.\"; and\n(c) by inserting, immediately after the word \"concurrences,\" in paragraph 5, the words \"aviation safety instruments,\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Air Navigation Act (Cap. 6) for 2 main objectives:\n(a) to enable Singapore to bring its aviation safety regulatory framework in line with internationally recognised and accepted terms. The International\nCivil Aviation Organization (the ICAO) has passed a Global Rule\nHarmonization\nResolution, urging countries to promote global harmonization of national rules for the application of the ICAO standards. In particular, the ICAO encourages use of the precise language of the ICAO regulatory standards in national legislation and regulations, as far as practicable; and\n(b) to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (the CAAS), as regulator, has a range of options to enforce compliance with the Act, instead of or in addition to referring matters to the Public Prosecutor for the purposes of prosecuting. While prosecution is an appropriate tool for serious breaches of aviation security, the fundamental purpose of aviation security regulation is to encourage and effect compliance.\nThe Bill also contains consequential amendments to the Civil Aviation\nAuthority of Singapore Act 2009 (Act 17 of 2009).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nLong title amendments\nClause 2 amends the long title to the Act to make it clear the scope and purpose of the modern regulatory framework the amendments in the Bill will cover. The\ncontrol of air navigation under the Act is to maintain, enhance and promote safety and security in civil aviation, and to provide for the implementation of Singapore's obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago\nConvention) and any other international convention, agreement, or understanding relating to safety of civil aviation to which the Government is a party.\nChanges to definitions\nClause 3 amends various definitions in section 2(1) and introduces many new definitions used in the subsequent provisions in the Bill.\nThe general term \"aviation safety instrument\" is introduced to cover all manner of licence, permit, certificate, authorisation, approval or other document issued under or by virtue of the Act to or in respect of any person, aircraft, aerodrome, aeronautical procedure, aeronautical product, or aviation\u2010related service. This will cover certificates of airworthiness, aircraft maintenance licences, aerodrome certificates, pilot licences, air traffic control licences and air operator certificates, all of which are now issued or granted under the Air Navigation Order (O 2). The term \"aviation safety instrument\", however, does not include an airport licence within the meaning of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Act 2009.\nThe definition of \"state aircraft\" introduced in section 2(1) by clause 3 is substantially aligned with the Chicago Convention which deems state aircraft to be \"aircraft used in the military, customs and police services\". However, the definition of \"state aircraft\" does not include aircraft used in Singapore customs and police services, and aircraft which are used by the Singapore Armed Forces but which are nevertheless on the Singapore (civil) aircraft register. The application of civil aviation safety regulation to domestic customs and police services is commonplace around the world. It is, however, unusual for any aircraft used by military forces for military purposes to be subject to civil aviation safety regulation.\nBasic provisions on application\nClause 4 inserts new sections 2A to 2E which demarcate the Act's geographical application.\nThe new section 2A states the general rule of territorial application for legislation. That is, the Act applies to and in relation to every person, aircraft, aerodrome, aeronautical product, air service and aviation\u2010related service, in\nSingapore.\nHowever, under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago 1944 (the Chicago Convention), a State party to the Convention is generally responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft on that State's register, irrespective of where the aircraft is in the world, and requires aircraft to comply with the flight rules and regulations of the country of registration, wherever in the world they may be flying.\nIn addition, the country where an aircraft is registered is responsible for approving radio transmitting apparatus, for issuing certificates of airworthiness to aircraft, and\nfor certifying and licensing pilots. New section 2B reflects this international obligation by conferring Parts I and II of the Act (which deal with aviation safety) with extra-territorial application. The new section 2B essentially re-enacts section 14 of the Act (which is repealed by clause 13).\nFor example, the Act extends to every holder of an aviation safety instrument while outside Singapore and exercising or purporting to exercise privileges accorded by that instrument and every person in, or any of the crew of, any\nSingapore registered aircraft or aircraft operated by a Singapore operator, wherever they may be, in so far as the Act prohibits, requires or regulates the doing of anything by such persons in, or by any of the crew of, Singapore registered aircraft or aircraft operated by a Singapore operator. The general rule is that all Singapore registered aircraft even outside Singapore is subject to the Act and its subsidiary legislation unless displaced by any 83 bis agreement.\nThe new section 2C is a provision concerning Article 83 bis agreements.\nIf an aircraft is registered in one country but operated (such as by lease or charter) for a substantial period by an operator whose principal place of business or permanent residence is in another country, difficulties in administering safety regulations can arise. Article 83 bis of the Chicago Convention enables the transfer of safety regulatory functions from the State of registration of an aircraft to the\nState in which the aircraft is to operate, on agreement of both States. New section 2C allows certain provisions in the Act implementing the functions under\nArticles 12, 30, 31 and 32 of the Chicago Convention to be applied to a foreign aircraft identified in an Article 83 bis agreement which transfers those functions to\nSingapore, and to be disapplied to a Singapore registered aircraft identified in an\nArticle 83 bis agreement which transfers those functions to another State.\nNew section 2C therefore may be invoked whenever Article 83 bis agreements are made between the CAAS and foreign national airworthiness authorities. Public scrutiny and transparency is assured through a requirement in new section 2C that the CAAS must publish in the Gazette the particulars of such an Article 83 bis agreement or every amendment to such an agreement.\nThe new section 2D precludes the application of the Act to state aircraft generally, in accordance with the Chicago Convention. The Chicago Convention is expressed generally not to apply to state aircraft and deems state aircraft to be \"aircraft used in the military, customs and police services\". As a result, the standards applied to the operation of aircraft under the Chicago Convention are not required, as a matter of international law, to be applied to military, customs and police aircraft. New section 2D provides that the Act will not apply to any state aircraft or navigation by state aircraft and that the Act will not limit the privileges or immunities of any foreign state aircraft and the officers and crew of any foreign state aircraft.\nThe exceptions to section 2D are Part IIA (investigation into accidents including any accident involving a military aircraft during a flying display in Singapore), and any orders and regulations made under section 3 or 3A, respectively, which give effect to the Chicago Convention, Annex 2 (the Rules of the Air which extend to military aircraft).\nFinally, the new section 2E makes it clear that the Act will be binding on\nGovernment, and will apply to and in relation to aircraft belonging to or exclusively employed in the service of the Government, other than state aircraft.\nWhile the Government cannot be liable to be prosecuted for an offence, there is no immunity from prosecution for a member of the crew of an aircraft owned by the\nGovernment, or any other person employed by the Government.\nDivision of Act\nClause 5 replaces the heading of Part II to reflect the aviation safety framework that is to be introduced to facilitate harmonization of Singapore's aviation safety legislation with the ICAO standards. Part II of the Act will also make it explicit that the CAAS has the function of conducting the safety regulation of civil air operations in Singapore territory by means that include developing and promulgating appropriate, clear and concise aviation safety standards and issuing aviation safety instruments.\nModernising the aviation safety framework\nClause 6 amends section 3 which currently empowers the Minister to make\nOrders to give effect to the Chicago Convention. Several Orders have been made to date.\nSection 3 is amended firstly, to transfer the power of making Orders from the\nMinister to the CAAS. This is to align the Act with section 7(1)(a) of the Civil\nAviation Authority of Singapore Act 2009 which specifies as the CAAS' function \"to regulate safety and promote safety and security in civil aviation and to exercise safety regulatory oversight over civil aviation operations in Singapore and the operation of Singapore aircraft outside Singapore\". With the amendment, Orders may be made by the CAAS with the Minister's approval. However, the current power under section 3 to make Orders relating to investigations into aviation accidents and incidents and to aviation security are deleted, because international law and practice requires investigations into aviation accidents to be carried out by a body independent of the regulator and commercial interests, and aviation security requires national co-ordination which may be better discharged under the\nMinister's direct oversight. The subject-matter that has been carved out will be re-enacted under new Parts IIA and IIB by clauses 13 and 15, respectively.\nSecondly, section 3 is amended to provide for the regulation of the conditions under which noise and vibration may be caused by aircraft on aerodromes, which is the subject of the existing section 4. Next, section 3 is further amended to provide for compensation to be paid if any structure or valuable tree or plant is reduced in\nheight or removed or any expense is reasonably incurred in compliance with any\nOrder made under section 3 or the conditions of any such Order unless the structure was erected or the tree or plant was planted in contravention of any such Order or of the conditions imposed thereby.\nFinally, as the aviation safety framework is currently set out in various Orders (the main one being the Air Navigation Order) made under section 3, the amended section 3 provides for the continuation of the provisions in these Orders until the provision is revoked and replaced by regulations on aviation safety made under the new section 3A. These Orders may be amended under section 3 until regulations replace them completely.\nClause 7 inserts new sections 3A to 3E which are necessary to support the modern aviation safety framework.\nThe new section 3A confers power on the CAAS to make regulations, with the approval of the Minister, prescribing matters necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out the Chicago Convention and any other similar international aviation convention, agreement, or understanding to which the\nGovernment is a party, in relation to safety of civil aviation. The new section 3A substantially replicates the scope of matters that Orders may be made under section 3. This is to enable the modernisation of the safety framework to start in phases in articulations according to subject-matter set out in different regulations, instead of a massive single Air Navigation Order.\nThe new section 3B allows the CAAS, when making regulations under the new section 3A or amending Orders under section 3, to refer to external documents made either by itself or by other agencies and incorporating the contents thereof as if the contents formed part of the regulations or Order. Modern aviation safety standards, procedures and practices are developed nowadays by expert technical bodies and other authorities, and may change quickly and frequently in response to important safety-related factors. In order to ensure that the regulations and Orders reflect the most current safety standards, procedures and practices, new section 3B seeks to facilitate the process by which these materials can be lawfully and effectively incorporated, adopted or applied in a timely way.\nThe new section 3C deals with codes, standards, specifications and the like which have been issued by the CAAS to provide practical guidance or certainty in respect of the statutory requirements for aviation safety. It provides that the observance or failure to observe any provision in such codes, standards, specifications or the like may serve as a basis for determining whether criminal liability has arisen or whether administrative action should be taken by the CAAS or any other licensing authority under the Act.\nThe new section 3D defines what is meant by a \"fit and proper person\", an expression that is used to an eligibility criteria for an aviation safety instrument.\nThis generally involves having regard to the degree and nature of the person's\nproposed involvement in the Singapore civil aviation system, and to the matter of the person's compliance history with aviation safety regulatory requirements, the person's relevant knowledge, competency and experience, any history of physical or mental health or serious behavioural problems, any conviction for any offence whether or not the conviction was in a Singapore court and evidence that the person has committed an aviation safety offence or has contravened or failed to comply with any provision in any Order or regulation made under the Act.\nFinally, the new section 3E empowers the CAAS to delegate the exercise of all or any of its powers under the Act, any Order made under section 3 or any regulations made under section 3A to the Director-General of Civil Aviation, to such of its employees as it appoints under section 3E to be a safety inspector or to such other individuals who are not its employees as it appoints under section 3E to be a safety inspector. However, the CAAS cannot delegate to any individual who is not an employee of the CAAS any power under section 4C, 4D, 4E or 4G with respect to any aviation safety instrument, as the power to revoke or suspend any aviation safety instrument or debarment are draconian powers.\nAviation safety instruments\nClause 8 repeals section 4 (which provides for the regulation of the conditions under which noise and vibration may be caused by aircraft on aerodromes) the contents of which are re-enacted in new sections 3(3A) and 3A. In place of section 4 are 2 new Divisions to Part II of the Act.\nDivision 2 of Part II comprises 10 new sections (sections 4 to 4I) relating to aviation safety instruments.\nThe new section 4 provides that an aviation safety instrument will be required if regulations made under section 3A state so before a person can undertake a range of activities in connection with civil aviation, such as aircraft operators, aircraft owners, aircraft pilots and flight crew members, air traffic service personnel, aircraft maintenance personnel, aerodromes and aerodrome operators, aviation training organisations and aircraft design, manufacture and maintenance organisations.\nIt is an offence for a person to operate, maintain or service or do any other act in respect of any aircraft, aeronautical product or aviation\u2010related service referred to above and for which an aviation safety instrument is required by the aviation safety subsidiary legislation if the person does not hold an aviation safety instrument that is in force. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $50,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction for the like offence, to a fine not exceeding $100,000.\nThe new section 4A deals with the grant and renewal of aviation safety instruments by the CAAS. One of the factors that must be considered by the CAAS before doing so is whether the applicant and any person who is to have or is likely to have control over the exercise of the privileges under the aviation safety instrument either holds the relevant qualifications and experience prescribed by the\naviation safety subsidiary legislation or holds such foreign qualifications or certifications, licences or permits issued by a foreign aviation authority as are acceptable to the CAAS, and whether the applicant or such person is a fit and proper person to have such control or hold the aviation safety instrument. For the purpose of granting or renewing an aviation safety instrument, the CAAS is allowed to accept such foreign qualifications or recognise such certifications, licences or permits issued by a foreign aviation authority as it considers appropriate in each case. If the CAAS refuses to grant or renew an aviation safety instrument, the person aggrieved may appeal against that decision to the Minister in the time and in the manner prescribed by the aviation safety subsidiary legislation.\nThe new section 4B relates to the general duties of the holder of an aviation safety instrument. Essentially, the holder of an aviation safety instrument must comply with the relevant aviation safety subsidiary legislation, and the conditions attached to the relevant aviation safety instrument the person holds, and must ensure that the activities or functions for which the aviation safety instrument has been granted are carried out by the person, and by all persons for whom the person is responsible, safely and in accordance with the relevant safety standards and practices prescribed by the aviation safety subsidiary legislation. Where the aviation safety instrument authorises the provision of a service within the civil aviation system, the holder of the aviation safety instrument must establish and follow a management system that will ensure compliance with the relevant safety standards prescribed and the conditions attached to the aviation safety instrument, must provide training and supervision to all employees of the person who are engaged in doing anything to which the aviation safety instrument relates, so as to maintain compliance with the relevant safety standards prescribed and the conditions attached to the document and to promote safety, and must provide sufficient resources to ensure compliance with the relevant safety standards prescribed and the conditions attached to the aviation safety instrument.\nThe CAAS' power to take regulatory action against holders of aviation safety instruments are set out in new sections 4C, 4D and 4E.\nThe current regulatory powers under the Act and the Air Navigation Order in relation to holders of aviation safety instruments concentrate at the more serious end of the scale in terms of potential consequences for the holders. For example, should a holder of an aviation safety instrument breach any condition of its instrument or any statutory requirements relating to that instrument, the holder faces prosecution or the possible revocation or suspension of the instrument thus preventing the person from continuing to operate. The new sections 4C, 4D and 4E seek to provide a set of middle range sanctions to address regulatory issues and contraventions, particularly in instances where the breaches are not serious enough to warrant preventing a holder of an aviation safety instrument from continuing to operate.\nUnder the new section 4C, the CAAS is empowered to suspend or impose conditions on an aviation safety instrument where safety demands this and the holder of the aviation safety instrument has failed to comply with any conditions of the aviation safety instrument or that the privileges or duties for which the aviation safety instrument has been granted are being carried out by the holder in a careless or incompetent manner. Suspension or imposition of conditions on an aviation safety instrument relating to the use of any aircraft, aeronautical product, or the provision of any service, may also be applied if the CAAS considers that there is reasonable doubt as to the airworthiness of the aircraft or as to the quality or safety of the aeronautical product or service to which the aviation safety instrument relates. The CAAS has to take into account the criteria in new section 4F in deciding whether to take such action.\nEvery suspension of any aviation safety instrument and any conditions imposed thereon take immediate effect and remains in force for up to 10 working days unless, before the expiry of that 10-working day period, the CAAS extends the suspension or conditions for a further specified period. The immediate effect is to allow the CAAS to decide whether to take one or more of the following actions with regard to the aviation safety instrument:\n(a) impose conditions in respect of the aviation safety instrument for a specified period;\n(b) withdraw any conditions in respect of the aviation safety instrument;\n(c) suspend the aviation safety instrument in whole or part for a specified period;\n(d) revoke or partially revoke the aviation safety instrument;\n(e) impose permanent conditions on it.\nThe new section 4D empowers the CAAS to revoke or impose permanent conditions on an aviation safety instrument if it considers it necessary to do so in the interests of aviation safety and after an inspection, monitoring, or investigation carried out under this Part. Revocation may be in respect of the whole or any part of an aviation safety instrument. Before exercising any powers under this section, the\nCAAS has to observe a process that ensures that the holder of the aviation safety instrument concerned has a right of hearing. The CAAS has to take into account the criteria in new section 4F in deciding whether to take such action. The holder of an aviation safety instrument who is aggrieved by any decision of the CAAS under this section may appeal to the Minister.\nTo deal with cases where a holder of an aviation safety instrument is contravening, or is likely to contravene, any condition of the aviation safety instrument, and there are reasonable grounds to believe there is a serious and imminent risk to air safety, the new section 4E empowers the CAAS to make a provisional order where appropriate or requisite to avoid any actual or imminent\noccurrence that endangers or threatens to endanger the safety of the public. The\nCAAS can make a provisional order instead of an immediate 10-day suspension under section 4C or of revoking or imposing permanent conditions under section 4D.\nSuch a provisional order will require the holder of the aviation safety instrument concerned to do, or not to do, such things as are specified in the provisional order or are of a description so specified, for 3 months. It takes immediate effect and no opportunity to be heard is required before a provisional order is made. However, the CAAS has to balance the extent to which any person is likely to sustain loss or damage in consequence of anything which, in contravention of the condition of the aviation safety instrument, is likely to be done, or omitted to be done, against the making of the provisional order.\nThe provisional order will lapse at the end of 3 months unless confirmed by the\nCAAS. The CAAS has to give the holder of the aviation safety instrument concerned an opportunity to be heard before confirming the order and the continuation of its terms. Confirming a provisional order with modifications will require the consent of the holder of an aviation safety instrument to whom the order relates. However, there are some exceptions against confirming a provisional order.\nThis includes an instance where the holder of the aviation safety instrument has agreed to take, and is taking, all such steps as it appears to the CAAS for the time being to be appropriate for the holder of that instrument to take for the purpose of securing or facilitating compliance with the condition in question, or the contraventions were, or the apprehended contraventions are, of a trivial nature.\nThe new section 4F sets out the criteria for taking action against any person under new section 4C, 4D or 4E. The CAAS is obliged to take into account certain matters when deciding whether to take such action, many of which are similar to who is a \"fit and proper person\". For example, the person's compliance history with aviation safety regulatory requirements, any conviction offence, whether or not the conviction was in a Singapore court, and any evidence that the person has committed an aviation safety offence or has contravened or failed to comply with any provision in or any order or regulation made under the Act. The CAAS is of course not confined to considering the matters specified in new section 4F and may take into account such other matters and evidence as may be relevant.\nThe new section 4G is a debarment provision. Where an aviation safety instrument has been wholly revoked under new section 4D, the person who was the former holder of that aviation safety instrument will be disqualified, for such period as may be specified by the CAAS, from holding the same aviation safety instrument or such other related aviation safety instrument, as the CAAS will specify. A person commits an offence if he applies for or obtains an aviation safety instrument while disqualified by a debarment order of the CAAS under the new section 4G. There is a right of appeal to the Minister for a former holder of an\naviation safety instrument who is aggrieved by any debarment decision of the\nCAAS under the new section 4G.\nIn order for the CAAS to deal quickly and effectively with developments in or changes to the aviation safety system, new section 4H empowers the CAAS to issue directives to any holder or holders of aviation safety instruments to do, or not to do, such things as are specified in the directive or are of a description as specified therein, being directives not inconsistent with the Act, any Order made under section 3 or any regulations made under section 3A (collectively called the aviation safety subsidiary legislation), or the conditions of the aviation safety instrument.\nThis will include circumstances where the CAAS considers such action necessary in the interests of promoting or protecting safety or public health or ensuring environmental sustainability, or where the CAAS is satisfied that the holder of the aviation safety instrument has failed to comply with any conditions of the aviation safety instrument or the CAAS considers that the privileges or duties for which the aviation safety instrument has been granted are being carried out by the holder in a careless or incompetent manner. In the case of an aviation safety instrument relating to the use of any aircraft, aeronautical product, or the provision of any service, or impose conditions in respect of any such document, the CAAS may also issue such directives if it considers that there is reasonable doubt as to the airworthiness of the aircraft or as to the quality or safety of the aeronautical product or service to which the aviation safety instrument relates.\nThe CAAS can issue directives to the holder of any aviation safety instrument whether or not any regulatory proceedings are instituted under section 4C, 4D or 4E according to the circumstances of the case. Every directive takes effect when the directive is given to the holder of an aviation safety instrument concerned or on a later date specified in the directive, and the holder must comply with that directive as soon as it takes effect. No opportunity to be heard needs to be given to the affected holder of an aviation safety instrument if it is not practicable or desirable to do so.\nFinally, the new section 4I empowers the Director-General of Civil Aviation to make emergency directives of general application as may be necessary to alleviate or minimise any risk of the death of, or a serious injury to, any person or of damage to any property, where it is impracticable in the circumstances of the particular case for the CAAS to make an Order under section 3 or regulations under section 3A to effectively alleviate or minimise the risk concerned. An emergency directive can be inconsistent with any aviation safety subsidiary legislation, and will prevail for so long as it is in force.\nHowever, an emergency directive of general application can be in force for a period not exceeding 90 days but may be renewed by the Director-General of Civil\nAviation once only for a further period not exceeding 30 days. It is also possible for the emergency directive to be revoked in that time.\nAs a general rule, every emergency directive must be published in the Gazette unless, for reasons of safety or security it is impracticable to notify the emergency directive in the Gazette, in which case the Director-General of Civil Aviation must notify such person or persons as he thinks appropriate or necessary in the circumstances. Every emergency directive of general application will come into force immediately upon its being published in the Gazette or, where notified by service on any person as above, immediately upon service of the notification upon that person and in respect of that person only.\nThe new Division 3 of Part II consists of 6 new sections 4J to 4O, setting out powers for safety inspections, powers of enforcement in connection with the aviation safety framework in Part II and mandatory reporting of certain contraventions.\nThe new section 4J deals with the carrying out of safety inspections or monitoring of any holder of an aviation safety instrument, or any person who operates, maintains or services, or does any other act in respect of, any aircraft or aeronautical product, or who provides any aviation-related service or air traffic service, in the interests of civil aviation safety. The Director-General of Civil\nAviation or a safety inspector is empowered to require from such persons the information that the Director-General of Civil Aviation or safety inspector, as the case may be, considers relevant to the inspection or monitoring. If a person who is given notice to undergo a safety inspection or monitoring, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the requirements of the notice, the person commits an offence, the penalty of which is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.\nThe new section 4K empowers the Director-General of Civil Aviation or a safety inspector to require the holder of an aviation safety instrument to undergo an investigation conducted by the Director-General of Civil Aviation or a safety inspector if the Director-General of Civil Aviation or safety inspector, as the case may be, has reasonable grounds to believe that the holder has failed to comply with any conditions of the aviation safety instrument, or considers that the privileges or duties for which the instrument has been granted are being carried out by the holder in a careless or incompetent manner, and the investigation is necessary in the interests of civil aviation safety.\nWhere the CAAS believes on reasonable grounds that the operation or use of any aircraft or aeronautical product or any class of aircraft or aeronautical products may endanger persons or property, new section 4L empowers the CAAS to detain the aircraft or any aircraft of that class, seize the aeronautical product or any aeronautical products of that class or prohibit or impose conditions on the operation of the aircraft or aircraft of that class, or the use of any aeronautical product or any aeronautical products of that class.\nHowever, where the Director-General of Civil Aviation believes that prompt action is necessary to prevent the danger, the Director-General of Civil Aviation has more extensive powers and may do all or any of the following:\n(a) prohibit or impose conditions on the operation of the aircraft or all aircraft of that class;\n(b) prohibit or impose conditions on the use of the aeronautical product or aeronautical products of that class;\n(c) detain particular aircraft or seize particular aeronautical products where necessary in order to prevent their operation or use.\nThe Director-General of Civil Aviation or CAAS must, if requested by the owner or the person for the time being in charge of an aircraft detained or an aeronautical product seized, provide in writing to the owner or that person the reasons for the detention or seizure. Any person who is aggrieved by any decision of the Director-\nGeneral of Civil Aviation or CAAS may appeal to the Minister.\nAny detention or seizure can be maintained for only such time as is necessary in the interest of safety; but, if any aircraft, aeronautical products, or parts thereof are required for the purpose of evidence in any prosecution under the Act those aircraft, aeronautical products, or parts thereof may be retained by the Director-\nGeneral of Civil Aviation or CAAS for such period as the Director-General of Civil\nAviation or CAAS considers necessary for that purpose.\nThe new section 4M confers on the CAAS, the Director-General of Civil\nAviation or a safety inspector power to require any holder of an aviation safety instrument or other person to furnish documents and information relating to any matter which is considered necessary for the administration or enforcement of\nPart II and which are within the knowledge of that person or in his custody or under his control. The power also extends to the CAAS, the Director-General of Civil\nAviation or a safety inspector, as the case may be, requiring the attendance of a person to provide an explanation of the document or information and if the document or information is not furnished, to require that person to state, to the best of his knowledge and belief, where it is.\nIt is an offence to fail without reasonable excuse to furnish the required document or information, and the penalty is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.\nIt is also an offence for the person to intentionally alter, suppress or destroy any document or information which he has been required to furnish by a notice from the CAAS, the Director-General of Civil Aviation or a safety inspector, as the case may be, or in furnishing any document or information so required, to make any statement which he knows to be false in a material particular or recklessly makes such a statement. The penalty for this offence is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years or both.\nThe new section 4N covers other powers of enforcement such as powers of entry to premises and aircraft. It confers on the Director-General of Civil Aviation and every safety inspector the right of access at any reasonable time to any aircraft, aerodrome, building, or place, or to any document or record concerning any aircraft, aeronautical product, or aviation-related service. Where the Director-\nGeneral of Civil Aviation and any safety inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that any breach of any provision in Part II or any applicable aviation safety subsidiary legislation is being or about to be committed, or a condition imposed under any aviation safety instrument is not being complied with, or a situation exists within the civil aviation system or is about to exist that constitutes a danger to persons or property, they may at any reasonable time enter any aircraft, aerodrome, building, or place, and exercise various powers of inspection to determine whether or not such a matter exists.\nTo contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that relevant information on safety is reported, collected, stored, protected and disseminated by the CAAS, new section 4O imposes mandatory reporting to the CAAS of safety matters which the applicable aviation safety subsidiary legislation will define to be reportable. These are called reportable safety matters.\nSafety matters cover occurrences involving any Singapore registered aircraft or any aircraft operated by a Singapore operator, any facility on the ground used or intended to be used for purposes of or in connection with the operation of such an aircraft, which endanger or which, if not corrected, would endanger an aircraft, its occupants or any other person, including and not limited to defects or malfunctioning of the aircraft or any part thereof. Any information that relates to compliance, or failure to comply, with any provision of the Act or of any aviation safety subsidiary legislation, or with the law of any Contracting State in which the aircraft operates, is also a safety matter. The aviation safety subsidiary legislation may also specify any other occurrence that affected, is affecting, or might affect safety of transport by air to be a safety matter.\nThe mandatory reporting requirement is imposed on any person who operates, maintains, or services, or does any other act in respect of, any aircraft, aeronautical product or aviation-related service, such as pilots, operators, maintenance organisations, etc., if prescribed by any aviation safety subsidiary legislation.\nThey are called responsible persons.\nA responsible person is not excused from not giving any information that is a reportable safety matter because the information might tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty.\nTo encourage reporting, if a responsible person, before giving any information that is a reportable safety matter, claims that the disclosure of the information might tend to incriminate him, the new section 4O provides that the information and the giving of the information will not be admissible in evidence against the person in any criminal proceedings other than proceedings for an offence under the new\nsection 29C (on providing false information). The clause acknowledges that a coercive information-gathering power must be accompanied by appropriate protection for the informant. However, nothing in new section 4O will prevent any agency from separately collecting and using information that is a reportable safety matter for the purpose of judicial or other proceedings.\nPatents\nClause 9 amends section 5 by deleting subsection (1) thereof because the provision has been made redundant by section 66(2)(d) of the Patents Act (Cap. 221). Section 66(2)(d) of the Patents Act already states that it is not an infringement of any patent if the act \"consists of the use of a product or process in the body or operation of a relevant aircraft, hovercraft or vehicle which has temporarily or accidentally entered or is crossing Singapore (including the air space above it and its territorial waters) or the use of accessories for such a relevant aircraft, hovercraft or vehicle\".\nDivision of Act\nClause 10 also introduces a Division 4 for Part II of the Act, with a heading that refers to special powers and prohibited photography.\nSerious risks to aviation safety\nClause 11 inserts Division 5 comprising 6 sections (sections 8 to 8E) covering serious risks to aviation safety.\nThe new section 8 deals with interference with aeronautical facilities. If the\nCAAS believes on reasonable grounds that an installation is or may be, either actively or passively, causing interference with communications to or from aircraft, or communications to or from centres established for air traffic control, or with navigational aids or with surveillance systems, in circumstances that are likely to endanger the safety of aircraft engaged in international air navigation or air navigation within, to or from Singapore, the CAAS may request the proprietor of the installation to allow it to be inspected and tested. The CAAS may direct the proprietor to modify the installation, or to take such other action as is necessary to eliminate the cause of the interference if as a result of such an inspection or otherwise, the CAAS considers it necessary to do so for the safety of aircraft.\nHowever, the proprietor may recover from the CAAS the amount of all reasonable expenses incurred, and of losses actually suffered, in complying with CAAS' direction if the installation had been lawfully operated before.\nNon-compliance without reasonable excuse with CAAS' direction is an offence with a penalty of a fine not exceeding $10,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding $50 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction.\nThe new section 8A makes it an offence for a person to tamper with an aircraft or any part thereof, or an aeronautical product that is of such a type that tampering\nwith it may endanger the safety of an aircraft or any person or property, if tampering with it may endanger the safety of the aircraft or any person or property.\nThe penalty is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nThe new section 8B covers a variety of offences dealing with unruly passengers.\nThe text of the provision is guided by the resolution that the ICAO adopted at its\nAssembly in Montreal in October 2001, which urged Contracting States to enact law and regulations to deal effectively with the problem of unruly passenger offences, incorporating as far as practicable a Model Legislation on Certain\nOffences Committed on Board Civil Aircraft.\nFirst, a person who, while in an aircraft is in flight, does any act that interferes with a crew member of the aircraft in the course of the performance of the crew member's duties connected with the safe operation of the aircraft, or behaves in a threatening, offensive, insulting or disorderly manner towards a crew member of the aircraft will be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.\nIf a person fails to comply with any commands given to the person directly by the pilot-in-command, or indirectly by the pilot-in-command through a crew member, which are commands given for the safe operation of the aircraft in flight and the safety and well-being of all passengers and crew on board and the safety of cargo carried on the aircraft, the person will also be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.\nIt is also an offence for an intoxicated person to board an aircraft or for a person to become intoxicated on an aircraft in flight. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. In any proceedings against a person for this offence under subsection (3), it is a defence for the person charged to prove that either he was, at the material time, in a state of intoxication or became intoxicated not because of being under the influence of any alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating substances, or that he was at the material time a person under the supervision of a crew member and was in a state of intoxication or became intoxicated as a result of taking prescription medication in accordance with a medical authorisation.\nA person who operates a portable electronic device on board an aircraft in breach of any aviation safety subsidiary legislation, or who smokes in an aircraft when instructed not to smoke by any crew member or any passenger information sign or placard in the aircraft, will also be guilty of an offence. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\nThe Act's jurisdiction will extend to the commission of these offences in any\nSingapore registered aircraft, wherever it is in the world (see new section 2A), but\nnot such acts committed on board non-Singapore registered aircraft outside\nSingapore even while they are flying into to land at Singapore.\nNext, the new section 8C is concerned with the offence of operating, maintaining or servicing, or doing any other act in respect of, any aircraft, aeronautical product or aviation-related service by a person in a manner that could endanger the life of another person or could endanger the person or the property of another person. The person must either know or ought reasonably to have known that his act would have that effect.\nAlso, a person must not cause or permit any aircraft, aeronautical product or aviation\u2010related service to be operated, maintained or serviced, or cause or permit any other act to be done in respect of any aircraft, aeronautical product or aviation\u2010related service, in a manner that could endanger the life of another person, or could endanger the person or the property of another person. The person must either know or ought reasonably to have known that his act would have that effect.\nThe penalty for both these offences is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nThe new section 8D makes it an offence for an owner or operator or pilot\u2010in\u2010command of any Singapore registered aircraft to commence a flight or permit a flight of that aircraft if the aircraft does not have a requisite certificate of airworthiness. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or a jail term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nFinally, the new section 8E sets out the offence of trespassing at aerodromes. A person who is guilty of this offence faces a penalty of a fine not exceeding $5,000.\nClause 12 first amends section 10 to raise the punishment for the offence of dangerous flying from a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both, to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nInvestigations into aviation accidents\nClause 13 repeals sections 13 and 14 and re-enacts in its place a new Part IIA (consisting of 3 Divisions) dealing with reporting of aviation accidents and incidents, the carrying out of investigations into such accidents and incidents and the making of safety recommendations to address safety deficiencies identified by investigations. The arrangements in the new Part IIA are based on the principles of international best practice for investigation currently adopted in the aviation transport sectors.\nDivision 1 of new Part IIA consists of 5 sections (sections 13 to 13D). The new section 13 sets out definitions of terms used in subsequent provisions in the new\nPart IIA. Many of these terms are currently in use under the Air Navigation (Investigations into Accidents and Incidents) Order (O 7).\nThe new section 13A defines the type of accidents to which Part IIA applies. As an exception to new section 2D (which excludes state aircraft and the navigation of such aircraft from the application of the Act), Part IIA applies to accidents involving military aircraft during a flying display in Singapore. Otherwise, Part IIA applies to all accidents or incidents involving civil aircraft.\nAs investigations that are independent of the parties involved in an accident and transport regulators are better positioned to avoid conflicts of interest and external interference, the new section 13B confirms the establishment and continuation of a department of the Government known as the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau of\nSingapore or AAIB. AAIB will consist of the public officers who are appointed by the Minister as Inspectors of Accidents and such other public officers as are necessary for the proper functioning of the AAIB. Such independence for the accident investigation authority is consistent with the Chicago Convention.\nThe new section 13C makes it clear that the purpose of investigations under\nPart IIA is the prevention of accidents and incidents, and not to apportion blame or liability. Any investigation carried out by AAIB under Part IIA will be separate from any judicial or administrative proceedings to apportion blame or liability.\nThe new section 13D deals with the relationship of new Part IIA with other written laws. It makes clear that new Part IIA does not limit the powers of authorities like the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore to investigate accidents under any written law for the time being in force relating to merchant shipping. It also makes clear that any investigation under Part IIA or its outcome will not limit the powers of the CAAS or any other licensing authority of cancelling, suspending or endorsing any aviation safety instrument or other approval, licence, permit or other document issued or granted under the Act or any subsidiary legislation made under the Act.\nDivision 2 of new Part IIA consists of 3 sections (new sections 13E, 13F and 13G). It deals firstly, with mandatory reporting requirements of accidents involving\nSingapore registered aircraft and aircraft operated by a Singapore operator, and secondly, with the setting up of a scheme for the collection from any person of information on observed deficiencies in civil aviation which are not required to be reported under the new section 4O, but which are perceived by the holder as an actual or potential hazard.\nThe new section 13E covers compulsory reporting of accidents and serious incidents. Under this section, people responsible for reporting must report matters related to accidents and serious incidents. Regulations made under new section 13E will identify the people responsible for reporting, nominated officials to receive reports and the manner of reporting. Responsible persons for the purposes of reporting will include only those with an operational connection to the aircraft such as the crew, the owner and/or operator of the aircraft or persons performing control duties like air traffic controllers. The principles of this\nprovision and the penalties applying to the failure to report accident matters are derived from the existing aviation legislation.\nNon-reporting may result in a penalty of up to a maximum of $100,000 fine or imprisonment of 5 years or both. An offence has to be created for the failure to report is intended to ensure that responsible persons who may wish to deliberately conceal the fact that an accident or serious incident has occurred, perhaps motivated by insurance implications or employer disciplinary sanctions, will be discouraged from doing so. Timely reporting will enable the AAIB to act quickly.\nThe new section 13F empowers the Minister to establish by rules (called voluntary reporting rules) published in the Gazette a scheme the principal purposes of which are to enable any person (not necessarily a holder of an aviation safety instrument) to voluntarily report aviation safety issues without action being taken against the person. This is to give effect to Paragraph 5.1.2 of Annex 19 to the\nChicago Convention, which contains a recommendation for Contracting States to establish a voluntary incident reporting system to facilitate the collection of information that may not be captured by a mandatory incident reporting system.\nThe Minister will designate one or more persons to receive these reports (referred to as the designated persons). Details about the designated persons and the operation of the scheme will be prescribed in the rules but no designated persons will be the CAAS.\nIn order to facilitate identifying deficiencies and problems in the Singapore aviation safety system and to provide data for safety improvements to that system, the voluntary reporting rules will provide that information from the reports may be used by a designated person to identify unsafe procedures, practices or conditions in order to prevent or reduce the likelihood and severity of future aviation accidents and incidents. While adhering to the confidentiality requirements required by new section 13G, the voluntary reporting rules may allow for the issuing by any designated person of information briefs and alert bulletins that can then be used by the industry to change operational practices or by the CAAS to make changes in the regulatory system or introduce additional education campaigns or surveillance.\nThe scheme is not intended to be a whistle-blowing scheme and the protection will only apply to the person who reports the aviation safety issue. The scheme will also not cover reportable matters to be reported to the CAAS under the new section 4O, accidents and serious incidents which must be investigated under\nPart IIA and conduct or transactions that constitute an offence under any written\nlaw. Concerns involving a serious and imminent threat to a person's health or life, or about a serious crime, are also not to be reported under the scheme to be established under new section 13F. The scheme's confidentiality requirements covering the reporter would make it inappropriate for any designated person to have in his possession personal information that cannot be released but which could prevent an imminent death or serious injury or resolve a serious crime.\nAs Paragraph 5.3.1 of Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention states that a voluntary incident reporting system must be non-punitive and afford protection to the sources of information, under new section 13G, a person who observes or becomes aware of an aviation safety issue can report such concerns confidentially.\nA report of an aviation safety issue made by a person (referred to as the reporter) to a designated person in accordance with the voluntary reporting rules, any evidence of the contents of such a report, and the fact that such a report of an aviation safety issue was made, is declared not admissible in evidence against the reporter in any proceedings before any tribunal in Singapore, any civil proceedings or any criminal proceedings before any court in Singapore.\nThere is an exception for criminal proceedings in relation to whether the making of a report constitutes an offence under section 29C which deals with the giving of false reports. This is to ensure that, if necessary, court proceedings can be carried out to prosecute a person for intentionally providing false or misleading information and thereby deter vexatious reporters from abusing the scheme.\nThe new section 13G also prevents employers from taking disciplinary action against any of its employees who is a reporter under the voluntary reporting rules.\nA tribunal is also not entitled to make a decision of an administrative character (whether or not in the exercise of a discretion) under any written law against a reporter using information derived from a report of an aviation safety issue made by the reporter in accordance with the voluntary reporting rules.\nHowever, the new section 13G does not confer absolute immunity from prosecution and other action. It will not prevent the use of information derived from a source that is not a report of an aviation safety issue made to any designated person in accordance with the voluntary reporting rules.\nThe new section 14 outlines all the necessary powers for any Inspector of\nAccidents to obtain all the information that the Inspector of Accidents considers relevant to a safety investigation under Part IIA, particularly in cases where a person does not wish to be cooperative. This includes requiring the attendance of a person for the purpose of an investigation and requiring production of specified evidential material. There is no explicit provision for either legal counsel or any other person to accompany the person attending before an Inspector of Accidents.\nThe new section 14 also enables an Inspector of Accidents to enter premises without a warrant or consent. This is to enable an Inspector to gain access to accident sites and other premises in order to preserve and collect, as soon as possible, potentially vital evidence relevant to an investigation. As there is usually considerable evidence on an accident site that is perishable, it may be impracticable or impossible to get a warrant in time, and so it is imperative to gain access to the site in a timely fashion without having to obtain a warrant first. It may also be impractical to gain consent to enter an accident site as this may unduly delay the commencement of the evidence preservation and collection process. This power\nalso extends to vehicles, which, by their transient nature, may also need to be quickly accessed in case they are removed to a less accessible location where relevant evidence may be removed or destroyed simply by virtue of the vehicle relocating.\nThe new section 14A gives power to the Chief Inspector of Accidents, an investigator in charge of the investigation into an accident or serious incident (referred to as the investigator-in-charge) or an authorised person (such as a police officer) to secure the perimeter of an accident site, to prevent any person from entering or remaining on the accident site without his permission. The power is necessary as it enables better control over the preservation of evidence. However, new section 14A is not intended to restrict access by other agencies with legitimate grounds to investigate, though such access necessarily has to be under the supervision of the Chief Inspector of Accidents, the investigator-in-charge or an authorised person. For example, the Chief Inspector of Accidents will have to liaise with the police or other enforcement agencies and provide advice regarding site access, evidence preservation and safety issues.\nThe new section 14A(2) has exceptions. These exceptions include conduct ensuring the safety of persons, animals or property, the removal of deceased persons or animals, making safe vehicles and wreckage, and conduct to protect the environment from significant damage. This will allow, for instance, first response agencies to ensure the safety of persons, animals and property, and coroners to remove bodies from the wreckage of a transport vehicle for the purposes of a coroner's inquiry.\nThe new section 14B provides for the appointment by the Minister of an accredited representative and one or more advisers to assist the accredited representative for the purposes of investigations where an accident or incident which occurs in another Contracting State and Singapore is the State of Registry,\nState of the Operator, State of Manufacture or State of Design of the aircraft involved in the accident or incident, or Singapore, at the request of the Contracting\nState conducting the investigation, is requested to provide information, facilities or experts to the State in connection with the investigation.\nThe new section 14C sets out the elements of the offence of hindering an investigation. A person must be reckless as to any possible adverse impacts of his or her conduct, and that the conduct must have the result of adversely affecting an investigation, and the conduct is not authorised by the Chief Inspector of\nAccidents, an Inspector or a person acting under the authority of the Minister. The provision is intended to cover conduct such as withholding information, concealing evidence, tampering with evidence, etc., but no conduct will constitute an offence unless it actually has an adverse effect on an investigation.\nNew section 14C is broader than new section 29D it covers conduct that is not directed at a particular official but rather hindering an investigation or future investigation more generally.\nThe new section 14C not only relates to accident sites where it is very important that evidence is preserved, but also extends to include such things as the destruction or removal of evidence remote from the accident site such as minutes of meetings, training records and data recordings where information may provide crucial evidence pertinent to the investigation. To discourage persons from tampering with evidence before the matter is reported to the Chief Inspector of\nAccidents and an investigation can be commenced, where an immediately reportable matter has occurred, the offence may apply before the matter is reported and before the Chief Inspector of Accidents decides to investigate. A person would reasonably be expected to know that the Chief Inspector of Accidents is likely to investigate in such cases. Without such a provision, it would be possible for persons to tamper with evidence relating to a serious safety occurrence before reporting to the Chief Inspector of Accidents in the knowledge that they cannot be prosecuted for doing so with the real potential for critical safety information to be lost or destroyed. In incidents of a less serious nature, it would not reasonably be expected that a person would know that an investigation is likely to be conducted.\nFinally, the new section 14C(2) has exceptions to the offence. This is in addition to the standard defences under the Penal Code (Cap. 224). These are the same exceptions to the offence created under new section 14A.\nNext, the new section 14D re-states substantially the current restrictions on disclosure of information and records gathered in the course of investigations now found in the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Order. The term \"restricted information\" is used to refer to this sort of information. As defined by section 14D, it covers various types of information acquired by an Inspector or\nAAIB staff member under or in connection with the new Part IIA. It includes evidential material which is sensitive information that may have an adverse impact on the free flow of safety information in the future (and in turn have a substantial adverse impact on the proper and efficient conduct of an investigation conducted under Part IIA) if it was made freely available by AAIB for purposes other than transport safety.\nThe new section 14D prohibits a person who is or has been an Inspector or AAIB staff member or adviser, or who has been authorised to access restricted information, from disclosing the information to any person, and prevents a court from requiring such a person who is subject to the prohibition to disclose restricted information.\nThere are exceptions to the prohibition against disclosure of restricted information to any court or any person. Such exceptions include disclosure or copying in the course of the exercise of powers under Part IIA, disclosure to a court for purposes of criminal proceedings for an offence against Part IIA or section 29C (for example, providing false information), and disclosure to a court in proceedings where the High Court makes a public interest order. However, any information allowed to be disclosed will be admissible in court proceedings only to the extent\nthat new section 14(2) operates. New section 14(7) prevents admission of information in proceedings against a person where the person has given that information without being allowed to claim self-incrimination privilege.\nThe new section 14D also makes investigation reports inadmissible in evidence in civil or criminal proceedings whether through inadvertent disclosure or in contravention of Part IIA. This reinforces the purpose of investigations under\nPart IIA, which is that such information is to be used for the purpose of safety only and should not be used in the judicial system for the purpose of blame or liability, so as not to prejudice the free flow of safety information in future transport safety investigations. The exception is coroners' inquiries which share a similar purpose to investigations under new Part IIA.\nFinally, the new section 14E confers upon the Minister power to make regulations on the investigation into accidents and incidents. The Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Order that is made under section 3 of the\nAct today will continue until the Order is revoked by regulations made under the new section 14E.\nRegulation of provision of air services\nClause 14 amends section 16(1) on regulating the provision of air services. The\nMinister is empowered to specify more than one licensing authorities for the regulation of air services. A distinction has been drawn between scheduled and non-scheduled services and those provided under Air Services Agreements and those which are not, and different regulatory instruments with different licensing authorities may have to be provided for in the regulations made by the Minister.\nSection 16(1) is further amended to enable the regulations made by the Minister to require a certificate (now called an Air Traffic Rights Certificate) before a licence or permit to provide air services may be granted or continue to be held.\nAviation security\nClause 15 repeals section 17 and inserts, in its place, a new Part IIB which seeks to enhance the structure of the aviation security framework in line with the revised\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards so as to maintain and improve transport security in civil aviation while providing flexibility in order to reflect the rapidly changing threat environment.\nPart IIB has 7 sections (sections 17 to 17F). New section 17 sets out the definitions used in the Part. There is a detailed definition of the key term \"act of unlawful interference\" based upon guidance from the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO). The measures in the new Part IIB are designed to safeguard\nSingapore's civil operations against acts of such unlawful interference.\nThe term \"unlawful interference with aviation\" covers conduct that threatens the safe operation of aircraft and airports, and behaviour which may cause harm to passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public or damage to property.\nExamples are acts like hijacking, a bomb attack when an aircraft is in service, sabotage (such as mechanical interference) with the intention of damaging the aircraft, acts on-board an aircraft that is in service that puts the safety of the aircraft or any person on-board or outside the aircraft at risk, damage or interference with aviation control towers, beacons and like navigation facilities, and threats, hoaxes or other provision of information that would cause an aircraft to take such action that would put it at risk.\nThe other key definition is that of an \"aviation industry participant\" as this refers to persons who must have regard to aviation security matters as part of their business. The term includes an airport operator, an aircraft operator, a regulated air cargo agent, a person who occupies or controls an area of an airport (whether under a lease, sublease or other arrangement), the CAAS and any contractor who provides services to any of the persons already mentioned.\nThe new section 17A establishes the National Civil Aviation Security Authority whose function is, in consultation with the CAAS and the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Committee, to develop, implement and maintain the National Civil\nAviation Security Programme or NCASP in Singapore to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. The Minister must appoint either a public officer or a statutory authority established by any public Act for a public purpose as the National Civil Aviation Security Authority.\nThe National Civil Aviation Security Authority may in turn appoint suitably qualified police officers and other individuals to be aviation security inspectors.\nThe National Civil Aviation Security Authority is allowed to delegate, in writing, and subject to such conditions or restrictions as it thinks fit, all or any of its powers under the Act to any officer or employee of the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Authority who carries on activities that relate to national security, or any aviation security inspector. However, no further sub\u2010delegation is allowed.\nThe new section 17B establishes the National Civil Aviation Security\nCommittee, comprising such persons as the Minister may appoint, whose function is to advise the National Civil Aviation Security Authority on civil aviation security policies, strategic matters and decisions, and the measures necessary to meet threats to civil aviation.\nThe new section 17C sets out in general the powers of the National Civil\nAviation Security Authority, any police officer authorised by that Authority or an aviation security inspector for the purposes of determining whether a person is complying with the new Part IIB or investigating a possible contravention of that\nPart or for determining whether a security directive should be issued. An auxiliary police officer authorised by the National Civil Aviation Security Authority may also assist the National Civil Aviation Security Authority, any police officer authorised by that Authority or any aviation security inspector exercising in\nSingapore a power under the new Part IIB. An auxiliary police officer who is so\nduly authorised will have the same powers under this section as the police officer he is assisting.\nThe new section 17D specifically empowers the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Authority to issue security directives specifically or generally to a class.\nSecurity directives may be issued to any aviation industry participant, and to any person who is not an aviation industry participant if this other person operates, maintains, or services, or does any other act in respect of any aircraft, aeronautical product, aviation-related service, air traffic service, or aeronautical procedure (whether or not at an airport), or has access to the airside, a protected area or protected place in an airport for the purposes of any business carried on or service provided by the person.\nA security directive can also be given to control the movements of an aircraft on the ground. The pilot or operator of an aircraft in Singapore and not in flight can be given a security directive to take a specified action in relation to the aircraft. For example, if the National Civil Aviation Security Authority has reason to suspect that a particular aircraft has not been satisfactorily security cleared, that Authority can by a control notice detain the aircraft until its security clearance can be verified.\nThe National Civil Aviation Security Authority may also issue a control notice to an airport operator, for example requiring that all passengers and their luggage on a particular flight must be screened or re\u2010screened before the aircraft can depart from the airport.\nWhere an aviation security incident has occurred, a security directive may also be issued to control the movements of an aircraft in Singapore, or a Singapore registered aircraft. For example, on becoming aware of the occurrence of an aviation security incident on board an aircraft in flight, the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Authority could direct the aircraft to land in a designated location. In another example, in the event of an actual terrorist attack on Singapore territory, all aircraft within Singapore territory may be required by the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Authority to land, remain grounded, or remain within or outside a particular area for a specified period.\nA security directive will contain explicit directions to carry out within the time delimited such security measures as the National Civil Aviation Security Authority may specify, such as (but not limited to) screening of passengers and cargo and measures to control of access. The facility of a security directive will also enable the National Civil Aviation Security Authority to move quickly to implement new security measures or modify existing measures to address any rapidly changing nature of security threats.\nThe new section 17D provides that failure to comply with a security directive is an offence, for which penalties are a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. There is a defence of reasonable excuse.\nFor example, a pilot's primary responsibility is for the safety and security of the aircraft, and that practical considerations for maintaining the safety and security of\nthe aircraft may influence the pilot's ability to comply with a control notice. A pilot's failure to comply with a security directive that is physically impossible due to a shortage of fuel would trigger this defence.\nAs regulations made under this Part will require various aviation industry participants to develop and comply with a security programme, new section 17E makes it an offence if an aviation industry participant who is required by regulations to have a security programme does not have one, or if there is one, the aviation industry participant fails to comply with it. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. A security programme will regulate the operation of all persons performing a security function on behalf of the programme holder.\nFinally, new section 17F empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of the new Part IIB. Regulations will require various aviation industry participants to develop and comply with a security programme. In particular, the regulations will provide additional detail on the content and form of the security programmes and how these regulate the operation of all persons performing a security function. The regulations will require the security programmes to be approved by the National Civil Aviation Security Authority if adequate, and to be reviewed over time to maintain relevance. The regulations recognise that different parts of an airport or other aviation-related facility represent different risks to aviation security and will enable appropriate security measures to be applied to different parts of the airport and other aviation-related facility. By providing for much of the details to be set out in regulations, Part IIB will allow the Government to respond to the evolving security situation in a timely fashion, while preserving the necessary parliamentary oversight.\nAs the aviation security framework is currently set out in the Air Navigation (Aviation Security) Order that is made under section 3, the new section 17F provides for the continuation of this Order until the Order is revoked by regulations on aviation security made under the new section 17F.\nDivision of Act\nClause 16 divides the Act into a new Part IIIA (covering miscellaneous matters) after section 27.\nComposition of offences\nClause 17 amends section 28A (which relates to composition of offences) to designate different compounding authorities corresponding to whether the offence concerns aviation safety, aviation security or otherwise. In the case of a compoundable offence relating to aviation safety, the CAAS or any authorised\nCAAS officer may offer the necessary composition. A public officer appointed by the Minister may offer composition for other types of compoundable offences.\nSection 28A is further amended to provide that all composition sums must be paid into the Consolidated Fund and cannot be retained by the CAAS.\nFees and provisions of general application\nClause 18 inserts new sections 29A to 29F which cover a range of general matters for the proper administration of the Act.\nThe new section 29A deals with fees and charges. Where power is conferred to prescribe fees and charges by subsidiary legislation, the new section 29A allows fixing of different rates of fees and charges in respect of different classes of persons, aerodromes, aircraft, aeronautical products, aviation-related services, air traffic services, or aeronautical procedures, or on the basis of different times of use, or on any other differential basis. There is also implied a power to prescribe a penalty for late payment of any fee or charge, or any additional fees or charges for work or services carried out outside normal working hours or on public holidays and for the granting of a rebate of such fees or charges to any person who is liable to pay them. The new section 29A also empowers the CAAS to suspend an aviation safety instrument if any fee or charge payable for that aviation safety instrument is not paid by the date prescribed or fixed.\nThe new section 29B provides that any financial penalty payable by any person to the CAAS must be paid to the Consolidated Fund. It also makes clear that the\nCAAS is to institute proceedings to recover the sums which are payable to the\nConsolidated Fund as a debt due to itself (and not as a Government debt) and then pay over in gross all those sums so recovered to the Consolidated Fund. The person's liability to pay will not be affected by his aviation safety instrument, licence or permit ceasing to be in force. The new section 29B also makes clear that the CAAS' officers are impressed with the same legal responsibilities as civil servants with regard to the collection of composition sums and financial penalties as these are public moneys.\nThe new section 29C sets out the offence of providing to the CAAS or any other person information relevant to the CAAS' or the person's exercise of powers under the Act, or under any Order or regulations under the Act, knowing the information to be false. It also makes an offence for an applicant for any aviation safety instrument or other licence or permit, to fail to provide to the CAAS or other person information known to that applicant which is relevant to the CAAS' or other person's exercise of powers under the Act. The applicant only has a defence of reasonable excuse. The penalty for both offences is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.\nThe new section 29D makes it an offence for a person to refuse to give access to or obstructs, hinders or delays the Director-General of Civil Aviation, any safety inspector or any officer or employee of the CAAS, the National Civil Aviation\nSecurity Authority, an aviation security inspector or any police officer authorised to act for or assist the National Civil Aviation Security Authority, or any\nInvestigator in new Part IIA, who is acting in the discharge of his duties under the\nAct. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both. New section 29D does not derogate from new section 14C which is broader. However, it is not an offence under section 29D if the person refused to comply with any request, demand or order made or given by any safety inspector or aviation security inspector who fails to declare his office and refuses to produce his identification card on demand being made by that person.\nThe new section 29E empowers the Minister, by order published in the Gazette, to exempt any person or premises or any class of persons or premises from all or any of the provisions of the Act, subject to such terms or conditions as may be specified in the order.\nFinally, the new section 29F empowers the Minister to delegate to the Authority or any public officer in his Ministry any of the Minister's functions and powers under the Act or any subsidiary legislation made under the Act, except the following powers: the power to delegate further, the power to make subsidiary legislation and the power to hear appeals. The provision also allows a Minister of\nState designated by the Minister to hear appeals that the Minister is required to determine under the Act.\nMiscellaneous amendments\nClause 19 makes several amendments to various provisions in the Act to align them with the allocation of power to regulate aviation safety in the CAAS, whereas the Minister retains power to regulate matters concerning aviation security, investigations into accidents and incidents and the regulation of air services.\nClause 20 is a savings and transitional provision.\nConsequential amendments to other Acts\nClause 21 makes a series of consequential amendments to the Civil Aviation\nAuthority of Singapore Act 2009. The first amendment is to the function of the\nCAAS under section 7(1)(b) of that Act because clause 14 amends section 16 of the\nAir Navigation Act to enable the Minister to designate one or more licensing authorities to regulate the provision of air services. The CAAS will no longer be exclusively vested with the function of regulating the provision of air services.\nThe other amendment to section 7(1) is to expressly state that the CAAS, as the provider of air traffic control services, has to cooperate with the AAIB in relation to investigations under Part IIA of the Air Navigation Act.\nThe remaining amendments are to the Second Schedule to the Civil Aviation\nAuthority of Singapore Act 2009 because of the modernised aviation safety framework introduced by the Bill. The amendments confer express power on the\nCAAS to develop and issue appropriate, clear and concise aviation safety standards, codes or specifications relating to the flight crew engaged in operations of aircraft, the design, construction, maintenance, operation and use of aircraft and\nrelated equipment, the planning, construction, establishment, operation and use of aerodromes and any other matter that is the subject of any order or regulations made under the Air Navigation Act, and to develop effective enforcement strategies to secure compliance with these aviation safety standards, codes or specifications. This is consistent with section 7(1)(a) of the Civil Aviation\nAuthority of Singapore Act 2009 which specifies as the CAAS' function that of regulating safety and promoting safety and security in civil aviation and to exercise safety regulatory oversight over civil aviation operations in Singapore and the operation of Singapore registered aircraft or aircraft operated by a Singapore operator outside Singapore.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

This Act is the Intellectual Property (Dispute Resolution)\nAct 2019 and comes into operation on a date that the Minister appoints by notification in the Gazette.\nPART 1\nNew Part IXA\n2. The Arbitration Act (Cap. 10) is amended by inserting, immediately after section 52, the following Part:\n\"PART IXA\nInterpretation of this Part 52A.\u2014(1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,\n\"intellectual property right\" or \"IPR\" means \u2014\n(a) a patent;\n(b) a trade mark;\n(c) a geographical indication;\n(d) a registered design;\n(e) a copyright;\n(f) a right in a protected layout-design of an integrated circuit;\n(g) a grant of protection in respect of a plant variety;\n(h) a right in confidential information, trade secret or\nknow-how;\n(i) a right to protect goodwill by way of passing off or similar action against unfair competition; or\n(j) any other intellectual property right of whatever nature.\n(2) In this Part, a reference to an IPR includes an application for the registration of an IPR if the IPR is protectable by registration.\n(3) In this Part, \"IPR dispute\" includes \u2014\n(a) a dispute over the enforceability, infringement, subsistence, validity, ownership, scope, duration or any other aspect of an IPR;\n(b) a dispute over a transaction in respect of an IPR; and\n(c) a dispute over any compensation payable for an IPR.\n(4) In this section, \"registration\", in relation to an IPR, includes the grant of the IPR.\nIPR disputes may be arbitrated 52B.\u2014(1) The subject-matter of an IPR dispute is capable of settlement by arbitration as between the parties to the IPR\ndispute.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the IPR dispute is the main issue or an incidental issue in the arbitration.\n(3) An IPR dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration only because a law of Singapore or elsewhere \u2014\n(a) gives jurisdiction to decide the IPR dispute to a specified entity; and\n(b) does not mention possible settlement of the IPR dispute by arbitration.\n(4) In subsection (3), \"specified entity\" means any of the\nfollowing entities under the law of Singapore or elsewhere:\n(a) a court;\n(b) a tribunal;\n(c) a person holding an administrative or executive office;\n(d) any other entity.\nEffect of award involving IPR 52C.\u2014(1) This section applies if an award deciding an IPR dispute is made in arbitral proceedings.\n(2) The fact that a person is a third-party licensee or third-party\nholder of a security interest in respect of the IPR does not of itself make the person a person claiming through or under a party to the arbitral proceedings for the purposes of section 44(1).\n(3) However, subsection (2) does not affect any right or liability between a third-party licensee or third-party holder of a\nsecurity interest and a party to the arbitral proceedings whether \u2014\n(a) arising in contract; or\n(b) arising by operation of law.\n(4) In this section \u2014\n\"third-party holder of a security interest\", in relation to an\nIPR in dispute in arbitral proceedings, means a person who \u2014\n(a) is a holder of a security interest in respect of the\nIPR granted by a party to the arbitral\nproceedings; but\n(b) is not a party to the arbitral proceedings; \"third-party licensee\", in relation to an IPR in dispute in arbitral proceedings, means a person who \u2014\n(a) is a licensee (whether or not an exclusive\nlicensee) of the IPR under a licence granted by a party to the arbitral proceedings; but\n(b) is not a party to the arbitral proceedings.\nSetting aside award involving IPR 52D.\u2014(1) For the purposes of section 48(1)(b)(i), the\nsubject-matter of a dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration under this Act only because the subject-matter relates to an IPR dispute.\n(2) For the purposes of section 48(1)(b)(ii), an award is not contrary to public policy only because the subject-matter in respect of which the award is made relates to an IPR dispute.\nJudgments entered in terms of award involving IPR\n52E.\u2014(1) This section applies if \u2014\n(a) an award deciding an IPR dispute is made in arbitral proceedings; and\n(b) a judgment in terms of the award is entered under section 46.\n(2) Section 44(1) applies in relation to the judgment as if the reference in that section to an award made by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement were a reference to the judgment.\n(3) In this section, \"award\" includes a declaratory award.\nValidity of patent may be put in issue in arbitral proceedings\n52F. Section 82(2) of the Patents Act (Cap. 221) does not prevent a party from putting the validity of a patent in issue in arbitral proceedings.\".\nPART 2\nAmendment of section 7\n3. Section 7(1) of the Copyright Act (Cap. 63) is amended by inserting, immediately after the definition of \"Copyright Tribunal\" or\n\"Tribunal\", the following definition:\n\" \"Court\" means the High Court;\".\nMiscellaneous amendments\n4.

The International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A) is amended by\ninserting, immediately after section 26, the following Part:\n\"PART IIA\nInterpretation of this Part\n26A.\u2014(1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, \"intellectual property right\" or \"IPR\" means \u2014\n(a) a patent;\n(b) a trade mark;\n(c) a geographical indication;\n(d) a registered design;\n(e) a copyright;\n(f) a right in a protected layout-design of an integrated circuit;\n(g) a grant of protection in respect of a plant variety;\n(h) a right in confidential information, trade secret or know-how;\n(i) a right to protect goodwill by way of passing off or similar action against unfair competition; or\n(j) any other intellectual property right of whatever\nnature.\n(2) In this Part, a reference to an IPR is a reference to such an\nIPR whether or not the IPR is registered, or subsists, in\nSingapore.\n(3) In this Part, a reference to an IPR includes an application\nfor the registration of an IPR if the IPR is protectable by registration.\n(4) In this Part, \"IPR dispute\" includes \u2014\n(a) a dispute over the enforceability, infringement, subsistence, validity, ownership, scope, duration or\nany other aspect of an IPR;\n(b) a dispute over a transaction in respect of an IPR; and\n(c) a dispute over any compensation payable for an IPR.\n(5) In this section, \"registration\", in relation to an IPR, includes the grant of the IPR.\nIPR disputes may be arbitrated\n26B.\u2014(1) The subject-matter of an IPR dispute is capable of settlement by arbitration as between the parties to the IPR dispute.\n(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the IPR dispute is the main issue or an incidental issue in the arbitration.\n(3) An IPR dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration only because a law of Singapore or elsewhere \u2014\n(a) gives jurisdiction to decide the IPR dispute to a specified entity; and\n(b) does not mention possible settlement of the IPR\ndispute by arbitration.\n(4) In subsection (3), \"specified entity\" means any of the following entities under the law of Singapore or elsewhere:\n(a) a court;\n(b) a tribunal;\n(c) a person holding an administrative or executive office;\n(d) any other entity.\nEffect of award involving IPR 26C.\u2014(1) This section applies if an award deciding an IPR\ndispute is made in arbitral proceedings.\n(2) The fact that a person is a third-party licensee or third-party holder of a security interest in respect of the IPR does not of itself make the person a person claiming through or under a party to the arbitral proceedings for the purposes of section 19B(1).\n(3) However, subsection (2) does not affect any right or liability between a third-party licensee or third-party holder of a\nsecurity interest and a party to the arbitral proceedings whether \u2014\n(a) arising in contract;

As a result, the judgment is final and binding on the parties (in personam and not in rem) and on any person claiming through or under them and may be relied upon by any of the parties by way of defence, set-off or otherwise in any proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

The resulting arbitral award binds only the parties to the IPR dispute, and does not affect third parties.\nThe new section 26B(2) clarifies that the new section 26B(1) applies whether the IPR dispute is the main issue or an incidental issue in the arbitration.\nThe new section 26B(3) clarifies that an IPR dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration only because a law of Singapore or elsewhere \u2014\n(a) gives jurisdiction to decide the IPR dispute to a specified entity; and\n(b) does not mention possible settlement of the IPR dispute by arbitration.\nThe new section 26B(4) defines \"specified entity\" as used in the new section 26B(3).\nThe new section 26C(2) clarifies that the fact that a person is a third-party licensee or third-party holder of a security interest in respect of the IPR does not of itself make the person a person claiming through or under a party to the arbitral proceedings for the purposes of section 19B(1).\nThe new section 26C(3) clarifies that the new section 26C(2) does not affect any right or liability between a third-party licensee or third-party holder of a security interest and a party to the arbitral proceedings whether arising in contract or arising by operation of law.\nThe new section 26C(4) defines the terms \"third-party holder of a security interest\" and \"third-party licensee\" as used in the section.\nThe new section 26D(1) clarifies that for the purposes of Article 34(2)(b)(i) of the Model Law, the subject-matter of a dispute is not incapable of settlement by arbitration under the law of Singapore only because the subject-matter relates to an IPR dispute.\nThe new section 26D(2) clarifies that for the purposes of Article 34(2)(b)(ii) of the Model Law, an award is not in conflict with the public policy of Singapore only because the subject-matter in respect of which the award is made relates to an\nIPR dispute.\nThe new section 26E(1) clarifies that for the purposes of section 31(4)(a), the subject-matter of the difference between the parties to a foreign award is not incapable of settlement by arbitration under the law of Singapore only because the subject-matter relates to an IPR dispute.\nThe new section 26E(2) clarifies that for the purposes of section 31(4)(b), it is not contrary to the public policy of Singapore to enforce an award only because the award is in respect of a subject-matter that relates to an IPR dispute.\nThe new section 26F clarifies the effect of \u2014\n(a) an award (whether made in or outside Singapore) deciding an IPR dispute being made in arbitral proceedings; and\n(b) a judgment in terms of the award being entered under section 19 or 29.\nThe new section 26F(2) clarifies that in this case, sections 19B(1) and 29(2) apply in relation to the judgment as if \u2014\n(a) the reference in section 19B(1) to an award made by an arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement were a reference to the judgment; and\n(b) the reference in section 29(2) to a foreign award were a reference to the judgment.\nAs a result, the judgment is final and binding on the parties (in personam and not in rem) (and on any person claiming through or under them in a case mentioned in the new section 29F(2)(a)) and may be relied upon by any of the parties by way of defence, set-off or otherwise in any proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Under the amended section 20(1)(a), any person may refer to the\nRegistrar of Patents (the Registrar) the question whether the person is entitled to be granted (either alone or with any other persons) a patent. This does not change the meaning or intent of section 20(1)(a).\nClause 9(b) replaces in section 20(6) the word \"whether\" in the phrase \"(whether alone or with any other persons)\" with the word \"either\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"entitled to be granted\". As amended, section 20(6) refers to the situation where it is alleged on a reference that any person other than the inventor or the applicant for the patent has become entitled to be granted (either alone or with any other persons) a patent for the invention, or has or would have any right in or under any patent so granted or any application for such a patent.\nThere is no change to the meaning or intent of section 20(6). These amendments are being made for consistency with a similar set of amendments being made to sections 47(4), (5)(b) and (9), 80(1)(b) and (4)(b) and 82(4)(b) and (6).\nClause 9(c) amends section 20(7) such that when a question is referred to the\nRegistrar under that section, the Registrar may decline to deal with it if it appears to the Registrar that the question involves a matter which would be more conveniently dealt with by the High Court.\nClause 10 inserts a new section 32 to provide for a process to make observations on the patentability of an invention in a patent application.\nThe new section 32(1) provides that where an application for a patent has been published, any other person may make observations in writing to the Registrar on the question whether the invention is a patentable invention, stating reasons for the observations. The Registrar must, subject to the new section 32(2), consider the observations in accordance with the rules.\nThe new section 32(2) provides that the observations must be received by the\nRegistrar before the Registrar sends to the patent applicant a copy of an examination report under section 29(4), a copy of a search and examination report under section 29(5), or a copy of a supplementary examination report under section 29(6).\nThe new section 32(3) provides that a person does not become a party to any proceedings before the Registrar by reason only that the person makes observations under the new section 32.\nClause 11 inserts a new section 38A to provide for a new process to file a request for the Registrar to conduct a re-examination of the specification of a patent. This provides for a new process through which a patent may be revoked\nunder grounds similar to the grounds of revocation under section 80(1). This process is ex parte, unlike an application for revocation under section 80 which is an inter partes process. Unlike section 80, the new section 38A option enables a person to challenge the validity of a patent specifically through re-examination of the specification by an Examiner.\nThe new section 38A(1) provides that any person may, at any time after a patent is granted, file a request for the Registrar to conduct a re-examination of the specification of a patent for an invention on any of the grounds in the new section 38A(1)(a) to (g).\nThe new section 38A(3) provides that the Registrar may reject any request that fails to comply with any of the formal requirements for filing a request set out in the new section 38A(2).\nThe new section 38A(4) provides that the Registrar must not grant a request under the new section 38A(1) if the Registrar is of the view that the request is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the process.\nThe new section 38A(5) provides that no request under the new section 38A(1) may be filed where there are pending before the High Court or the Registrar any proceedings in which the validity of the same patent may be put in issue.\nThe new section 38A(6) provides that where proceedings before the High\nCourt or the Registrar, in which the validity of the same patent may be put in issue, are filed after a request under the new section 38A(1) is made, the Registrar may make such order or give such direction as the Registrar thinks fit concerning the request.\nThe new section 38A(7) provides that where the Registrar grants a request under the new section 38A(1), the Registrar must cause the specification of the patent to be re-examined by an Examiner so as to determine whether the ground specified in the request is made out.\nThe new section 38A(8) provides that if it appears to the Examiner during the re-examination of the specification of the patent that the ground specified in the request is made out, or that based on any document submitted under the new section 38A(2)(c)(ii) any other ground mentioned in the new section 38A(1) is made out, the Examiner must give the proprietor of the patent a written opinion to that effect. The Registrar must, upon receiving the written opinion, send the proprietor a copy of the written opinion.\nThe new section 38A(9) provides that the proprietor of the patent must respond to the written opinion in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period.\nThe new section 38A(10) provides that upon receiving the re-examination report prepared by the Examiner, the Registrar must send to the proprietor of the patent a copy of the report.\nThe new section 38A(11) provides that where the re-examination report issued under that section contains one or more unresolved objections (being an objection mentioned in the written opinion), the Registrar must make an order revoking the patent.\nThe new section 38A(12) provides that such an order for revocation may be \u2014\n(a) an order for the unconditional revocation of the patent; or\n(b) where one of the grounds mentioned in the new section 38A(1) has been established, but only so as to invalidate the patent to a limited extent, an order that the patent should be revoked unless within a specified time the specification is amended under section 83 to the satisfaction of the Registrar.\nThe new section 38A(13) provides that a decision of the Registrar or on appeal from the Registrar does not estop any party to any civil proceedings in which infringement of a patent is in issue from alleging invalidity of the patent on any of the grounds mentioned in the new section 38A(1), whether or not any of the issues involved were decided in the decision.\nThe new section 38A(14) provides that a decision of the Registrar to revoke a patent under that section has effect from the date of the grant of the patent.\nThe new section 38A(15) provides that a person does not become a party to any proceedings before the Registrar by reason only that the person files a request under the new section 38A(1), unless the person is the proprietor of the patent.\nThis makes the section 38A process an ex parte process, where the requesting party is not involved after filing the request.\nClause 12(a) replaces in section 47(4) the word \"whether\" in the phrase \"(whether alone or with other persons)\" with the word \"either\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to be granted that patent\". There is no change to the intent or meaning of section 47(4). As amended, section 47(4) refers to the situation where the Registrar finds, on a reference under that section, that either \u2014\n(a) the patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted that patent alone; or\n(b) the patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted that patent with other persons.\nClause 12(b) inserts in section 47(5)(b) the words \"(either alone or with other persons, as the case may be)\" after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to the patent\" in section 47(5).\nClause 12(c) amends section 47(8) such that when a question is referred to the\nRegistrar under that section, the Registrar may decline to deal with it if it appears to the Registrar that the question would be more conveniently dealt with by the\nHigh Court.\nClause 12(d) deletes and substitutes section 47(9). The new section 47(9) is different from the existing section 47(9) in 2 ways. First, the words \"(either alone or with other persons, as the case may be)\" have been inserted after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to the patent\". There is no change in meaning, as the meaning of the amended phrase is consistent with the interpretation of the original phrase \"not entitled to the patent\" in the existing section 47(9) given by the Court of Appeal in Cicada Cube Pte Ltd v National\nSecond, the new section 47(9) sets out the 2 scenarios under which the High\nCourt may possibly exercise jurisdiction to determine a question whether a patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted the patent, and provides for a different time bar to apply to each scenario. Under the new section 47(9), the High\nCourt must not determine a question whether a patent was granted to a person not entitled to be granted the patent \u2014\n(a) in the exercise of any declaratory jurisdiction to determine any question in an action for a declaration; or\n(b) in the exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to a reference to the Registrar under section 47, if the action or the reference (as the case may be) was commenced or made after the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the date of the grant of the patent, unless it is shown that the proprietor of the patent knew at the time of the grant or transfer of the patent that the proprietor was not entitled (either alone or with other persons, as the case may be) to the patent.\nIn particular, the time bar applicable to the scenario in the new section 47(9)(b) represents a change from the existing position in law in the decision of the Court of\nAppeal in Cicada Cube Pte Ltd v National University Hospital (Singapore) Pte\nClause 13 amends section 67 to remove the Registrar's jurisdiction to determine the question of whether a person has infringed a patent, as referred by that person and the proprietor of the patent by agreement.\nClauses 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 make related amendments to sections 69, 70, 72,\n74 and 75, and 76, respectively, that are consequent on the amendments being made by clause 13 to section 67.\nClause 19 amends section 78 to remove the Registrar's jurisdiction to make a declaration that an act does not, or a proposed act would not, constitute an infringement of a patent.\nClause 20(a) amends section 80(1) to give the High Court original jurisdiction to revoke a patent, where the application for revocation does not arise in any of the contexts specified in section 82(1)(a), (b), (c) or (e). Clause 20(c), (d), (f), (g) and\n(h) makes related amendments to section 80(2), (3), (5)(b), (8) and (9).\nClause 20(b) inserts in section 80(1)(b) the words \"(either alone or with other persons)\" after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to be granted that patent\". There is no change to the meaning or intent of section 80(1)(b). Under the amended section 80(1)(b), the court or the Registrar may, on application of any person, by order revoke a patent for an invention on the ground that either \u2014\n(a) the patent was granted to a person who was not entitled to be granted that patent alone; or\n(b) the patent was granted to a person who was not entitled to be granted that patent with other persons.\nClause 20(e) inserts in section 80(4)(b) the words \"(either alone or with other persons, as the case may be)\" after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to the patent\", in line with the clarificatory amendment made to section 80(1)(b) by clause 20(b).\nClause 20(i) inserts a new section 80(11) to provide that where an application is made to the Registrar under section 80, the Registrar may at any stage of the proceedings refer the application to the High Court.\nClause 21 makes a clarificatory amendment to the heading of section 81.\nClause 22(a) amends section 82(1) by inserting a new paragraph (aa) to provide that the validity of a patent may be put in issue in a request for re-examination of the specification of a patent under the new section 38A.\nClause 22(b) makes a related amendment to section 82(1)(d) consequent on the amendments made by clause 20 to section 80.\nClause 22(c) inserts in section 82(4)(b) the words \"(either alone or with other persons, as the case may be)\" after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to the patent\", in line with the clarificatory amendments made to section 80(1)(b) and (4)(b) by clause 20(b) and (e).\nClause 22(d) inserts in section 82(6) the words \"(either alone or with other persons)\" after the word \"entitled\" to clarify the meaning of the phrase \"not entitled to it\". There is no change to the meaning or intent of section 82(6).

This is because a duplicate or counterpart of an instrument executed on or after 19th February 2011 will be exempt from duty unless it is the first instrument to be stamped, in which case it must be stamped as an original instrument under section 12(a).\nThe clause also inserts a new subsection (2) in the section to provide that a duplicate or counterpart of an instrument executed before 19th February 2011 is deemed to be duly stamped if it bears a stamp certificate indicating that it is a duplicate or counterpart, in order to preserve the effect of old section 12(b).\nClause 3 inserts a new section 12A to provide that an instrument executed on or after 19th February 2011 need not be stamped if the original or a duplicate or counterpart of that instrument has already been duly stamped.\nClause 4 amends section 15 (Relief from ad valorem stamp duty) \u2014\n(a) to provide for relief from stamp duty for a conveyance, assignment or transfer on sale of property, or the transfer, assignment or disposition of any mortgage or debenture, carried out in the course of converting a private company to a limited liability partnership;\n(b) to provide for relief from seller's stamp duty for a conveyance, assignment or transfer on sale of immovable property, carried out in the course of a reconstruction or amalgamation, a transfer of assets between associated entities, or the conversion of a firm or private company to a limited liability partnership; and\n(c) to provide that duty for which relief was previously granted may be recovered once a prescribed matter occurs, without the Commissioner of Stamp Duties (the Commissioner) having to be satisfied at the time the relief was granted that the matter would not occur.\nClause 5 makes various amendments to section 15A (Relief from ad valorem stamp duty for acquisition of shares of companies).\nClause 5(a) inserts a new subsection (2A) to replace the existing subsection (11) (which is being deleted under clause 5(h)) to provide for the circumstances in which an instrument to which section 15A applies will be regarded as duly stamped. In particular, the subsection clarifies that only the acquiring company may bring the instrument to the Commissioner for adjudication under section 37, even where it is the acquiring subsidiary that acquired the ordinary shares in the target company.\nClause 5(b) deletes paragraph (b) of subsection (3) as this is to be provided for under paragraph (d) of subsection (3) (vide the amendment by clause 5(d)).\nClause 5(c) amends subsection (3)(c)(ii) to clarify that the reference is to the financial year of the acquiring company.\nClause 5(d) amends subsection (3)(d) to remove the concept of \"a relevant financial year of the acquiring company\" and substituting this with that of \"a qualifying period\".\nClause 5(e) deletes subsections (4), (5) and (6) and substitutes a new subsection (4) to define the concept of a qualifying period for the purpose of determining which acquisitions of shares in a target company qualify for the relief under section 15A. Under the new subsection (4)(a), the qualifying period is, in the first instance, the financial year of the acquiring company (even where the acquisition of ordinary shares in the target company was made by the acquiring subsidiary). This qualifying period may be changed in the circumstances referred to in the new subsection (4)(b) and (c). Where the qualifying period is changed from one period to another, acquisitions that were qualifying acquisitions by virtue of having been made in the first period and which do not fall in the other period will cease to be qualifying acquisitions.\nConversely, where an acquisition was not a qualifying acquisition as it was not made during the first period but falls within the other period, it will become a qualifying acquisition for the purposes of section 15A.\nClause 5(f) deletes and substitutes subsection (7). The new subsection (7) clarifies that the maximum amount of relief of $200,000 under section 15A is applicable in respect of acquisitions by both an acquiring company and its acquiring subsidiary of ordinary shares in all target companies, and is based on acquisitions in the financial year of the acquiring company. Where the applicable qualifying period is not a financial year of the acquiring company, the new subsection (7) provides that the qualifying acquisitions in the qualifying\nperiod are deemed to be qualifying acquisitions in the financial year of the acquiring company in which an acquisition referred to in subsection (3)(a) or (c) occurs.\nClause 5(g) makes a consequential amendment to subsection (8) arising from the amendment by clause 5(d).\nClause 5(h) deletes and substitutes subsection (11) and inserts new subsection (11A). The new subsection (11) provides that refunds in respect of ad valorem stamp duty paid on qualifying acquisitions entitled to the relief under section 15A may be made pursuant to section 75 with some modifications. In particular, the new subsection (11) provides that it is the acquiring company that may apply for the refund (even in respect of acquisitions by its acquiring subsidiary).

These include \u2014\n(a) the nominal duty for a duplicate or counterpart of an instrument;\n(b) the nominal duty for certain instruments executed in pursuance of another instrument which has been duly stamped;\n(c) the fixed duty for a lease of any kind not mentioned in Article 8 and not otherwise specially charged with duty;\n(d) the fixed duty on an instrument of partition; and\n(e) the fixed duty on a surrender of lease otherwise than for a consideration.\nThe clause also exempts from duty an instrument for the transfer, assignment or conveyance of property in a case where the transaction is effected by more than one instrument and one of the other instruments has been duly stamped.\nClause 13 makes consequential amendments to the Third Schedule following the removal of the nominal duty for a counterpart or duplicate of an instrument and the fixed duty on an instrument of partition.\nClause 14 amends the Fourth Schedule to clarify that the relevant adjudication fee set out in that Schedule is payable whether or not the instrument qualifies for relief under section 15; and provides for the adjudication fees for an instrument connected with the conversion of a firm or private company to a limited liability partnership, as well as an instrument for share acquisition made in connection with a merger or acquisition under section 15A.\nClause 15 is a savings provision. It clarifies that the removal of fixed and nominal duties under the Bill does not apply to instruments executed before 19th February 2011. These instruments, if chargeable with duty under the law in force before that date, will continue to be so chargeable, and the duty is payable by the person liable to pay the duty under the Act in force before that date.\nThe clause further clarifies that the removal of duty for an instrument of partition will not affect its liability to duty under any other Article of the First\nSchedule. Such an instrument may by its contents be subject to ad valorem duty under other Articles of the Schedule e.g. as a conveyance on sale or a gift.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 67 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting \"$1,000\" in subsection (2) and substituting \"$1,500\"; and\n(b) by deleting subsection (3) and substituting the following subsection:\n\"(3) The offence under subsection (2) shall be a seizable offence within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).\".\nAmendment of section 83\n26. Section 83 of the principal Act is amended \u2014\n(a) by deleting \"$50\" in subsection (2) and substituting \"$1,000\"; and\n(b) by inserting, immediately after subsection (2), the following subsection:\n\"(3) The offence under subsection (2) shall be a seizable offence within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68).\".\nTransitional provision\n27. Section 7 of this Act shall apply only to and in relation to every written application by any person for the restoration of his name to a register of electors made on or after the commencement of that section under section 26 of the principal Act.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Presidential Elections Act (Cap. 240A) \u23af\n(a) to enable all or part of election proceedings to be postponed or suspended and adjourned to another day in the event nomination proceedings, polling or counting, as the case may be, are obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by natural or man-made catastrophes;\n(b) to impose a ban on election advertising, election meetings and canvassing on the eve of any polling day and polling day itself;\n(c) to prohibit individuals who are non-citizens from knowingly publishing or displaying, or knowingly causing or permitting to be published or displayed, any election advertising among any electors during the period beginning with the day the writ of election is issued for an election and ending on the start of the eve of polling day at the election; and\n(d) to raise the penalties for various offences under the Act, most of which have remained unchanged since 1993.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 introduces a new section 7A to enable the Prime Minister to issue a fresh writ of election when there is a total failure of the election. These are instances where no candidate is nominated, or returned as elected e.g. the polls have to be aborted mid- way due to some catastrophe.\nClause 3 amends section 10(4) to provide for the refund of election deposits in the event there is a total failure of an election.\nClause 4 amends section 16 to adjust the earliest date polling day may be fixed, and to clarify the process should one of several candidates nominated die before polling\nday.\nWith the first set of amendments, the earliest the date on which a poll can be taken will be a date that is not earlier than the 10th day after the date of publication of the notice of contested election in the Gazette, which is normally done on nomination day.\nThis change will ensure that, despite the introduction of a ban on campaigning on the eve of polling day and polling day itself, the minimum number of days of campaigning as permitted by law before the amendments will not be reduced. However, the last date by which the poll must be taken will still be not later than the 56th day after the date of\npublication of the notice of contested election in the Gazette, which is normally done on nomination day.\nAs for the other amendments in clause 4, as section 16(7) now stands, the Returning\nOfficer will countermand his notice for the poll and set a fresh date for the election, and the candidates that stood validly nominated at the time of countermand of the poll will be deemed nominated at the fresh election proceedings. The amendments in clause 4 make it clear that the notice issued by the Returning Officer is to set out a fresh date, time and place for the nomination of candidates like the notice in section 7, and the notice of the fresh nomination day must be given at least 4 clear days before the fresh date so fixed.\nClause 5 amends section 21(2) by raising the penalty for the offence of voting while not being entitled to do so from a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 9 months or to both. The person convicted will also become incapable for a period of 3 years from the date of his conviction of being registered as an elector or of voting at any election under the Act or of being elected as the President or a Member of\nParliament.\nClause 6 amends section 22(4) as a consequence of the insertion of new section 36C.\nClause 7 amends section 26(8) and (9) by raising the sum that an elector is required to pay in order to restore his name to a register of electors, if he does not have a good and sufficient reason for not recording his vote at an election. The new charge is $50.\nClause 8 amends section 27(4) by raising the penalty for making a false declaration as to his identity from a fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 9 months or to both.\nClause 9 amends section 31A to deal with the situation where polling in a particular polling station is temporarily suspended, adjourned and postponed or abandoned and re- started. The Returning Officer will have to specify a new date for the counting of votes cast at the election. The counting of votes cast at all other polling stations which have been directed to be counted together with the votes cast at the first-mentioned polling station also cannot start, so as to prevent the results of these other polling stations influencing the voters at the postponed or re-started poll.\nClause 10 amends section 36(7) (which sets out the offence of breaching the obligation to maintain secrecy of the vote) by raising the penalty from a fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 9 months or to both.\nClause 11 inserts new sections 36A to 36F to enable nomination proceedings, polling or counting of votes to be postponed or to be suspended and adjourned in the event those proceedings are or are likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by natural or man-made catastrophes. The circumstances in which such powers may be exercised range from riot or open violence, the threat of riot or open violence, storm, tempest, flood or an occurrence of a similar kind, a health hazard, a fire or the activation of fire safety equipment (such as sprinklers or alarms), any other\nreason related to the safety of voters or difficulties in the physical conduct of voting, or related to the safety of candidates and/or officials or difficulties in the physical conduct of nomination proceedings or counting, as the case may be.\nThe new section 36A empowers the Prime Minister to postpone nomination day at any time before that day. The Prime Minister must give notice of such postponement by notice published in the Gazette describing the postponement of nomination day or the change in the place of nomination, as the case may be. If publication in the Gazette is not practicable, the Prime Minister has to give notice in such manner as will secure adequate publicity describing the postponement of nomination day or the change in the place of nomination, as the case may be.\nThe new section 36B empowers the Returning Officer to change the hours for nomination of candidates at any time before nomination day. The Returning Officer must give notice of such postponement by notice published in the Gazette describing the change in the hours for the nomination of candidates. If publication in the Gazette is not practicable, the Returning Officer has to give notice in such manner as will secure adequate publicity describing the new hours for the nomination of candidates. The notice must also specify a period of one hour for the Returning Officer to receive nomination papers, a period of 90 minutes for the making of objections to any nomination paper, and the latest time by which a candidate must make his election deposit, may correct errors in the nomination papers and may withdraw his candidature.\nThe new section 36C empowers the Returning Officer to postpone polling to another polling day if it appears to him that the polling at all polling stations established for the purposes of the poll is likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected, before or during the polling at all those polling stations. If polling at some but not all polling stations is likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected, before or during the polling, the Returning Officer may instead, temporarily suspend the polling at the polling station for a period not exceeding 2 hours, with or without changing the location of that polling station, or postpone the polling at that polling station to another day, with or without changing the location of that polling station. The Returning Officer may also, depending on the circumstances of the case, abandon and postpone (by re-starting) the poll or terminate the poll early. In the case of an overseas polling station, the poll may be abandoned if the Returning Officer is satisfied that the poll thereat cannot be resumed or completed. Any poll at an overseas polling station, if resumed or held in place of the postponed poll, must close not later than the close of the poll on polling day in Singapore.\nThe Returning Officer must give notice of such postponement, abandonment or suspension by notification published in the Gazette describing the postponement, abandonment or suspension or the change in the polling station site, as the case may be.\nIf publication in the Gazette is not practicable, he has to give notice in such manner as will secure adequate publicity describing the postponement, abandonment or suspension of polling or the change in the polling station site, as the case may be.\nThe new section 36D states that where the polling at any polling station established for the purposes of the poll is so suspended or postponed under the new section 36C, only those electors who are registered electors, and are entitled to vote as electors at that polling station, and who have not already voted, will be entitled to vote on the date\nand time on and at which polling at that polling station is to resume or to be held in place of the postponed poll, as the case may be.\nThe new section 36E empowers the Returning Officer to temporarily suspend the counting at any counting place for a period not exceeding 2 hours, or to postpone the counting at that counting place to another day, with or without changing the location of that counting place, if it appears to the Returning Officer that the counting of votes at the counting place is or is likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected. The counting may also be abandoned if the Returning Officer is satisfied that the counting of votes at any counting place cannot be resumed or completed and that the number of votes to be counted will not affect the result of the election. In the case of an abandoned recount of votes at that counting place, he may then declare the election results using the results of the first count. Where the votes to be counted will affect the results of the election, the Returning Officer may abandon the counting at that counting place and re-start the poll at all polling stations which are specified in the direction under section 31A to be counted at that counting place.\nIn doing so, the Returning Officer must announce to such of the candidates and their counting agents as are present during the counting of the votes at the counting place concerned, the temporary suspension, adjournment, postponement or abandonment (as the case may be) of counting of votes at the counting place and the date and time on and at which counting of votes at that counting place is to resume or to be held in place of the suspended, adjourned, postponed or abandoned count, as the case may be, and by notice published in the Gazette declare the temporary suspension, adjournment, postponement or abandonment (as the case may be) of counting of votes at the counting place concerned and specify the date and time on and at which counting of votes at that counting place is to resume or to be held in place of the suspended, adjourned, postponed or abandoned count, as the case may be. Any temporary suspension, adjournment, postponement or abandonment (as the case may be) of the counting of votes at any counting place, and the counting of votes in place of the suspended, adjourned, postponed or abandoned count, must be carried out in the manner prescribed by regulations to be made under section 81.\nFinally, the new section 36F empowers the Returning Officer to temporarily suspend the addition or tallying of votes at the principal counting place for a period not exceeding 2 hours, or to adjourn and postpone the event to another day, with or without changing the location of the principal counting place, if it appears to the Returning\nOfficer that the addition or tallying of votes at the principal counting place is or is likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected. In doing so, the\nReturning Officer must announce to such of the candidates and their election agents as are present during the addition of the votes at the principal counting place, the temporary suspension, adjournment or postponement (as the case may be) of the tally and the date and time on and at which addition of votes at the principal counting place is to resume or to be held in place of the suspended, adjourned or postponed tally, as the case may be, and by notice published in the Gazette declare the temporary suspension, adjournment or postponement (as the case may be) of the addition of votes at the principal counting place and specify the date and time on and at which tallying of votes at the principal counting place is to resume or to be held in place of the suspended, adjourned or postponed tally. Any temporary suspension, adjournment or\npostponement (as the case may be) of the addition of votes at any principal counting place, and the addition of votes or the tallying of votes in place of the suspended, adjourned or postponed addition, must be carried out in the manner prescribed by regulations to be made under section 81.\nClause 12 raises the penalty for various election offences in section 37 from imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years plus a fine.\nClause 13 amends section 42 to raise the penalties for the various offences which are corrupt practices. The present penalty of a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both is inadequate.\nIn the case of the offence of personation, the present penalty of a fine of at least $250 but not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, is replaced by a penalty of a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both. The minimum fine is abolished but the maximum imprisonment term is raised.\nFor the offences of treating, undue influence and bribery, the enhanced penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or both. In the case of publishing election advertising without the proper identification particulars, the new penalty is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. As for the publication of false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct of a candidate or false statement of the withdrawal of a candidate, the new penalty is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. The new penalty for making a false declaration of election expenses is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.\nThe offences of undue influence and bribery and all other corrupt practices (except that of treating and of knowingly making a false declaration of election expenses) are each made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 14 amends section 53 by raising the penalty for parking, between 8 a.m. and\n8 p.m. on polling day, a motor vehicle within 100 metres of any polling station from a fine not exceeding $100 to a fine not exceeding $500. That offence, as well as the illegal practice of knowingly letting, lending, employing, hiring, borrowing or using a motor vehicle for the purpose of conveying electors or voters to or from the poll on polling day, are also made seizable offences in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant. The former restrictions on the exercise of such powers of arrest are abolished.\nClause 15 amends section 58 by raising the penalty for the offence by an employer of directly or indirectly, refusing, or by intimidation, undue influence or in any other manner, interfering with the granting to any elector in his employ of a reasonable period for voting. The penalty is raised from a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months to that of a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.\nClause 16 amends section 59 to extend the current prohibition as to the wearing, using, carrying or display of any badge, symbol, rosette, favour, set of colours, flag, advertisement, handbill, placard or poster or any replica of a voting paper as political propaganda on polling day to include the eve of polling day. The offence is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 17 amends section 60 and makes every offence of contravening any regulation regulating the display of posters and banners in respect of an election a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 18 inserts a new section 60A to stipulate a ban on election advertising during polling day and the eve of polling day. It will be an offence to knowingly publish, or knowingly cause or permit to be published, any election advertising among any electors during this period, or to knowingly display, or knowingly cause or permit to be displayed, any election advertising on any vehicle, thing or structure during this period.\nThe penalty is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\nA defendant will have a defence if he can show that the contravention of the new section 60A(1) arose from circumstances beyond his control, and that he took all reasonable steps, and exercised all due diligence, to ensure that that contravention would not arise. This will address any injustice arising from election advertising carried out by third parties without the consent, connivance or neglect of the candidate.\nThe ban on election advertising on the eve of polling day and polling day itself in new section 60A does not apply to the distribution of a book, or the promotion of the sale of a book, for not less than its commercial value, if the book was planned to be published regardless of whether there was to be an election, the publication of any news relating to an election in a newspaper in any medium by a person permitted to do so under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (Cap. 206) or in a radio or television broadcast by a person licensed to do so under the Broadcasting Act (Cap. 28), and to the telephonic or electronic transmission by an individual to another individual, on a non-commercial basis of the individual's own political views, such as by email on the\nInternet or by using an SMS or MMS system. Where the election advertising is already lawfully published or displayed, such as posters and banners and websites, the ban would also not apply to these so long as they remain unaltered. Other activities or other circumstances may be excluded from the ban if these are prescribed by the Minister by regulations under section 81.\nClause 19 amends section 61(1) which sets out the penalty for illegal practice. The maximum fine for illegal practice is raised from $300 to $2,000.\nClause 20 amends section 62 to extend the current prohibition on canvassing on polling day to include the eve of polling day. The penalty for the offence of canvassing on polling day e.g. visiting an elector on polling day at his home or place of work for any purpose in connection with an election, is raised from a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Every offence under the\nsection is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 21 introduces a new section 62A which imposes restrictions on election meetings, in addition to the provisions of the Public Order Act 2009 (Act 15 of 2009).\nElection meetings are public assemblies organised by or on behalf of a candidate nominated for election to promote or procure the electoral success at the election for one or more identifiable candidates or to otherwise enhance the standing of any such candidates with the electorate in connection with the election.\nThe first restriction is a ban on the holding of all election meetings on polling day and the eve of polling day. The ban is on all election meetings, wherever held, whether or not in an unrestricted area like Speakers' Corner in Hong Lim Park. The new section also makes it lawful for the Commissioner of Police to refuse to grant a permit for such an election meeting under Part II of the Public Order Act 2009 even if a notice under section 6 of that Act is given in respect of that election meeting.\nThe other restriction is on election meetings within unrestricted areas like Speakers'\nCorner during the campaign period. All such election meetings within any unrestricted area between nomination day and the day before the eve of polling day are prohibited unless the Commissioner of Police is notified under section 6 of the Public Order Act 2009 of the intention to hold the election meeting, and a permit is granted under section\n7 of that Act in respect of that election meeting.\nAny election meeting held in contravention of new section 62A(1) or (2) will be regarded as unlawful under Part II of the Public Order Act 2009. A person who organises or takes part in such an unlawful election meeting will be guilty of an offence under the Public Order Act 2009 and the police may issue any such person a direction to move-on under that Act.\nClause 22 amends section 63 (relating to the offence of dissuasion from voting) by raising the penalty for the offence from a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Every offence under the section is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 23 amends section 64 (relating to various offences of undue influence at or near polling stations on polling day) by raising the penalty for the offences from a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. Every offence under the section is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 24 amends section 65 by prohibiting an individual who is not a citizen of\nSingapore from knowingly publishing or displaying, or knowingly causing or permitting to be published or displayed, any election advertising among any electors during the period beginning with the day the writ of election is issued for an election and ending with the start of the eve of polling day at the election. The penalty for all offences under the section is also raised to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\nSection 65(7) is also amended to empower a police officer to arrest without warrant any person offending against section 65(1), (1A) or (2), whether or not offending in the police officer's view.\nThe other amendment to section 65 is to enable regulations to be made by the\nMinister under section 81 to exclude certain persons, or classes of persons, who carry out certain types of work pursuant to a contract for services with a person authorised to conduct election activity from the prohibition in section 65(1) against taking part in election activity, and from the requirement of written authorisation in section 65(2).\nFor example, manual work like erecting tents and stages carried out by foreign workers of a contractor with a written authorisation may be excluded by such regulations, thereby rendering permissible such actions which would otherwise be prohibited election activity.\nClause 25 amends section 67 (relating to the offence of operating a loudspeaker or other similar instrument so as to interfere with an election meeting) by raising the maximum fine for the offence from $1,000 to $1,500. The maximum imprisonment term of 12 months remains unchanged. The offence under the section is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 26 amends section 83 (relating to the offence of destroying, mutilating, defacing or removing, without lawful authority, any notice which is exhibited by any authority under the Act or any document which is made available for inspection in accordance with the Act) by raising the penalty for the offence from a fine not exceeding $50 to a fine not exceeding $1,000. The offence is also made a seizable offence in respect of which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant.\nClause 27 is a transitional provision dealing with pending applications by non-voters to restore their names to a register of electors. The new and higher restoration fee of $50 introduced by clause 7 will apply only to and in relation to an application by any person for the restoration of his name to a register of electors made on or after the commencement of that clause.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

Section 18 of the principal Act is amended by deleting subsection (6).\nNew sections 18A and 18B\n11. The principal Act is amended by inserting, immediately after section 18, the following sections:\n''Independence of accredited checking organisations 18A.\u2014(1) In addition to the requirements imposed on an accredited checker under section 18, where the certificate under section 6 (1) (c) or (8) is made by an accredited checker acting on behalf of an accredited checking organisation \u2014\n(a) the accredited checking organisation that is a corporation and any of its directors; and\n(b) any partner of the accredited checking organisation that is a partnership, shall not at the time of the making of the certificate have any professional or financial interest in the building works shown in the plans described in the certificate under section 6 (1) (c) or (8).\n(2) A person shall be regarded as having a professional or financial interest in any building works if \u2014\n(a) the person is or has been responsible for the design or construction of the building or any of the building works in any capacity except building works relating to the alterations of the building which \u2014\n(i) do not affect any key structural element; or\n(ii) affect any structural element but the effects are localised in nature and do not require any strengthening of any key structural element;\n(b) the person or any nominee of the person is a member, officer or employee of a company or other body which has a professional or financial interest in the building works; or\n(c) the person is a partner or is in the employment of a person who has a professional or financial interest in the building works.\n(3) For the purposes of this Act \u2014\n(a) a person shall be treated as having a professional or financial interest in the building works even if the person has that interest only as trustee for the benefit of some other person; and\n(b) in the case of married people living together, the interest of one spouse shall, if known to the other, be deemed to be also an interest of the other.\n(4) For the purposes of this Act \u2014\n(a) involvement in the building works as an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation; and\n(b) entitlement to any fee paid for the function as an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation, shall not be regarded as constituting a professional or financial interest.\n(5) Any accredited checking organisation that is a corporation which contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000.\n(6) Any partner of an accredited checking organisation that is a partnership, or any director of an accredited checking organisation that is a corporation, who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.\nExemption for certain public authorities\n18B.

The registration of any person as an accredited checker, and any certificate of accreditation issued, under section 16 of the principal Act before the date of commencement of section 7 of this\nAct shall lapse on that date.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Building Control Act (Cap. 29) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to provide for the appointment, registration and qualifications for registration of accredited checking organisations to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations of building works where the building works are valued above a prescribed limit, and to provide for the circumstances and procedures for suspension or cancellation of registration;\n(b) to amend the system of registration of accredited checkers to provide additional requirements for registration, to require that the registration be renewed annually, to empower the Commissioner of Building Control to suspend registration (in addition to cancelling registration) in certain circumstances and to specify additional grounds for cancellation of registration;\n(c) to impose a duty on the qualified person appointed by a person for whom building works are or are to be carried out to take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in ensuring that the structure of the building is designed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and (with certain exceptions) the requirements for structural design and loads prescribed in the building regulations and to make it an offence for the qualified person to fail to do so;\n(d) to clarify the position of site supervisors (who are appointed by the qualified persons) in relation to qualified persons (who are appointed by the person for whom building works are or are to be carried out); and\n(e) to make consequential and other minor amendments for the better administration of the Act.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 (1) to insert a new definition of ''accredited checking organisation''.\nClause 3 amends section 8 (1) to make clear that specified building works must be supervised by the appropriate qualified person or a site supervisor appointed by the appropriate qualified person and working under his control and supervision.\nClause 4 amends section 9 to make it the duty of the qualified person to take all reasonable steps and exercise due diligence in ensuring that the structure of the building is designed in accordance with the Act and (with certain exceptions) the requirements for structural design and loads prescribed in the building regulations.\nBreach of the duty is an offence punishable with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both.\nClause 5 makes minor amendments to section 10 as a consequence of the amendments to section 8 (to be made by clause 3).\nClause 6 repeals and re-enacts section 15 to provide for the keeping, maintenance and inspection of a register of accredited checkers and a register of accredited checking organisations and to provide that absence of a name from the respective registers is to be prima facie evidence that the person is not registered or that the person's registration has been suspended or cancelled.\nClause 7 amends section 16 \u2014\n(a) to provide that the manner of application for registration as an accredited checker and the documents and particulars to be provided are to be determined by the Commissioner of Building Control instead of being prescribed;\n(b) to provide that a person who wishes to be registered as an accredited checker must meet such other requirements as may be prescribed (in addition to the prescribed qualifications and practical experience);\n(c) to provide that the registration of an accredited checker shall be valid for a prescribed period and may be renewed;\n(d) to make it an offence for an accredited checker to undertake building works as an accredited checker on his own behalf if the value of the building works exceeds the prescribed limit and to define the terms ''prescribed limit'', ''prescribed period'' and ''value of the building works'';\n(e) to make it an offence for any person to undertake any work required to be undertaken by an accredited checker unless he is registered under the section and his registration has not been suspended or cancelled;\n(f) to empower the Commissioner of Building Control to cancel or suspend the registration of an accredited checker in specified circumstances;\n(g) to set out additional grounds on which the Commissioner of Building\nControl may cancel or suspend the registration of an accredited checker; and\n(h) to delete existing subsections (7) to (11) as they are covered under new sections 16B and 16C.\nClause 8 inserts 3 new sections, namely sections 16A, 16B and 16C.\nThe new section 16A provides for the registration, the procedures for registration and the requirements for registration of accredited checking organisations. Such an organisation must be a corporation licensed under the\nProfessional Engineers Act (Cap. 253) to supply professional engineering services in Singapore or a partnership consisting wholly of professional engineers registered under the Professional Engineers Act or which is licensed under the Professional\nEngineers Act to supply professional engineering services in Singapore. The\nCommissioner of Building Control is empowered to appoint a committee of persons to assist him in considering applications for registration as accredited checking organisations. A certificate of accreditation is to be issued by the Commissioner of\nBuilding Control to any person who is registered as an accredited checking organisation. The registration is valid for a prescribed period as defined in new section 16 (8) and may be renewed. It is an offence for any person to undertake work required to be undertaken by an accredited checking organisation unless the person is registered under the section and his registration has not been suspended or cancelled. The Commissioner of Building Control may suspend or cancel the registration of an accredited checking organisation in specified circumstances.\nThe new section 16B sets out the procedure for suspension or cancellation of registration of an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation. The\nCommissioner of Building Control must give the accredited checker (except where the accredited checker is deceased) or the accredited checking organisation, as the case may be, an opportunity to be heard. The Commissioner of Building Control is empowered to appoint a committee of persons to assist him in considering any representation that may be made. Where the Commissioner of Building Control suspends or cancels the registration of an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation, the relevant name and particulars shall be removed from the relevant register and the relevant certificate of accreditation shall be cancelled. The name and particulars of a person who has been suspended will however be reinstated, and the person's certificate of accreditation restored, at the end of the period of suspension. It is an offence for a person whose registration as an accredited checker or as an accredited checking organisation has been suspended or cancelled to fail to surrender his or its certificate of accreditation to the Commis- sioner of Building Control within 14 days of notification.\nThe new section 16C provides that a person whose application for registration as an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation is refused by the\nCommissioner of Building Control, or who is dissatisfied with a decision of the\nCommissioner of Building Control to suspend or cancel his or its registration, is entitled to appeal against the decision to the Minister whose decision is final.\nClause 9 repeals and re-enacts section 17 to provide that every person for whom building works are or are to be commenced or carried out shall (unless otherwise prescribed) appoint an accredited checker or an accredited checking organisation in respect of the detailed structural plans and design calculations of the building works. It is an offence for a person to appoint an accredited checker in respect of the detailed structural plans and design calculations of building works if the value of the building works exceeds the prescribed limit under new section 16 (5B). It is the duty of the accredited checker appointed under section 17, or an accredited checker acting on behalf of an accredited checking organisation appointed under that section, to check the detailed structural plans and design calculations of the building works in accordance with the building regulations and to carry out such other duties as may be prescribed in the building regulations and it is an offence if he fails to do so.\nClause 10 amends section 18 by deleting subsection (6) which is covered under the new section 18B.\nClause 11 inserts 2 new sections, namely sections 18A and 18B.\nThe new section 18A deals with independence of accredited checking organisations. The new section provides that in addition to the requirements imposed on the accredited checker under section 18, where the certificate under section 6 (1) (c) or (8) is made by an accredited checker acting on behalf of an accredited checking organisation, it is an offence \u2014\n(a) for the accredited checking organisation that is a corporation or any of its directors; or\n(b) for any of the partners of an accredited checking organisation that is a partnership, to have a professional or financial interest in the building works shown in the plans described in the certificate under section 6 (1) (c) or (8) at the time of the making of the certificate. The new section specifies certain circumstances in which a person will be regarded as having a professional or financial interest in any building works, and other circumstances in which a person will not be regarded as having such a professional or financial interest.\nThe new section 18B provides that the Minister may, by notification in the\nGazette, exempt from sections 16 (5B), 16A (7), 17 (2) and 18 (1) any building works which are carried out for any public authority constituted by any written law and in respect of which an accredited checker who is an officer or employee of the public authority has been appointed for the purposes of section 17 (1).\nClause 12 is a transitional provision. It provides that the existing registration of any person as an accredited checker and any certificate of accreditation issued\nunder the principal Act before the date of commencement of clause 7 of this Bill shall lapse on the date of commencement of that clause. The effect is that any person who had been registered as an accredited checker before the date of commencement of clause 7 must re-register under the principal Act if he wishes to be registered as an accredited checker on or after the date of commencement of that clause.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

and\n(b) the procedure and practice of applications made under this Part.\n(9) The regulations made under subsection (7) and the Rules of Court made under subsection (8) may provide for different requirements, conditions or procedures for different classes or descriptions of proceedings.\n(10) Any addition to or deletion or other variation of any\nrequirement mentioned in subsection (4) does not affect any agreement which was entered into before the date of commencement of that addition, deletion or variation.\nEffect of conditional fee agreement 115C.\u2014(1) A conditional fee agreement does not affect the\namount of, or any rights or remedies for the recovery of, any costs recoverable from the client by, or any costs payable to the client by, any person who is not the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that conducted the proceedings for the client, and that person may (unless he or she has otherwise agreed)\nrequire any costs payable or recoverable by him or her to or from the client to be assessed.\n(2) Despite subsection (1), the uplift fee (if any) is not recoverable from the person mentioned in that subsection.\n(3) Despite subsection (1), the client is not entitled to recover from any other person, under any order for the payment of any costs which are the subject of the conditional fee agreement, an amount that is more than the amount payable by the client to the\nsolicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that conducted the proceedings for the client.\n(4) It is an implied term of a conditional fee agreement that no claim may be made on a separate basis from the agreement by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity in respect of\nany services, remuneration or costs in relation to the conduct and completion of the contentious proceedings in respect of which the agreement is made, except such services, remuneration or costs (if any) as are expressly provided in the agreement.\n(5) Subject to the provisions of this Part, the costs of a\nsolicitor, a foreign lawyer or a law practice entity, in any case where there is a conditional fee agreement, are not subject to assessment nor to the provisions of section 118.\nEnforcement of conditional fee agreement 115D.\u2014(1) No action or suit may be brought or instituted\nupon any conditional fee agreement except for an application made under this Part.\n(2) Every question respecting the validity or effect of a conditional fee agreement may be examined and determined, and the agreement may be enforced or set aside on an application\nto the court of justice in which the contentious proceedings or any part of the proceedings was conducted, or, if the proceedings were not conducted in any court of justice, then by the General\nDivision of the High Court.\n(3) An application under subsection (2) may be made by any\nperson or the representatives of any person who \u2014\n(a) is a party to the conditional fee agreement; or\n(b) is or is alleged to be liable to pay, or is or is claiming to be entitled to be paid, the remuneration or costs in respect of which the agreement was made.\n(4) Upon an application under subsection (2), the court mentioned in that subsection may enforce a conditional fee agreement in any manner and subject to any condition as to the costs of the application that the court thinks fit, if the court finds\nthat \u2014\n(a) the requirements in section 115B have been complied with; and\n(b) the conditional fee agreement is neither void nor voidable on the ground of incapacity, fraud,\nmisrepresentation, duress, coercion, undue influence, unconscionability, mistake or any other ground for invalidating a contract, having regard to the circumstances in which the agreement was made and the interests of all the parties to the agreement\ntaken as a whole.\n(5) Upon an application under subsection (2), if the court mentioned in that subsection finds that the conditional fee agreement does not satisfy subsection (4)(a) or (b) \u2014\n(a) the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity is\nnot entitled to recover any amount in excess of the amount that would have been recoverable if the conditional fee agreement had satisfied subsection (4)(a) and (b), and must repay any excess amount received; and\n(b) subject to the limits mentioned in paragraph (a), the remuneration and costs incurred or chargeable in respect of the contentious proceedings included in the agreement are recoverable in the same manner and according to the same rules by which those\nremuneration and costs are recoverable on assessment if there had not been an agreement.\n(6) The court mentioned in subsection (2) may also make such order as to the costs of and relating to the application and the proceedings related to the application as the court thinks fit.\n(7) Within 12 months after a payment has been made under a conditional fee agreement, the person who made the payment may make an application under this section to the court mentioned in subsection (2), and the court may, if it is\nsatisfied that the special circumstances of the case so require \u2014\n(a) reopen the conditional fee agreement;\n(b) order the remuneration and costs to be assessed; and\n(c) order the whole or any portion of the amount received by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity\nto be repaid on such terms and conditions as to that court seem just.\n(8) Where any conditional fee agreement is entered into by the client in the capacity of trustee under a deed or will, or of guardian or donee or deputy (as defined in section 2(1) of the\nMental Capacity Act 2008) of a person who lacks capacity, and the estate or the property of the beneficiary or person will be chargeable with the amount payable under the agreement or with any part of that amount, the agreement must before payment be laid before the Registrar, who may examine it and disallow any\npart of it, or may require the direction of the General Division of the High Court to be taken on it.\n(9) If in a case mentioned in subsection (8), the client pays the whole or any part of the amount payable under the conditional fee agreement without the previous allowance of the Registrar or\nthe General Division of the High Court \u2014\n(a) the client is liable at any time to account for the amount charged to the estate or property mentioned in subsection (8); and\n(b) the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that\naccepted the payment may be ordered by the court mentioned in subsection (2) to refund the amount received by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity.\nDeath or incapacity of solicitor or foreign lawyer or winding up or dissolution of law practice entity after conditional fee agreement made 115E.\u2014(1) Where a solicitor or foreign lawyer has made a\nconditional fee agreement with his or her client and anything has been done by the solicitor or foreign lawyer under the agreement, and, before the agreement has been completely performed, the solicitor or foreign lawyer dies or becomes incapable to act, an application may be made under this section\nto the court by any party to the agreement or by the representatives of that party.\n(2) Where a law practice entity has made a conditional fee agreement with its client and anything has been done by the entity or any of its partners, directors, officers or employees\nunder the agreement, and, before the agreement has been completely performed by the entity or any of its partners, directors, officers or employees, the entity is wound up or dissolved, an application may be made under this section to the court by any party to the agreement or by the representatives of\nthat party.\n(3) The court has, upon the application under subsection (1) or (2), the same power to enforce or set aside the agreement, so far as it has been acted upon, as if the death, incapacity, winding up or dissolution had not occurred, and in exercising such power\nthe court must have regard to the terms of the conditional fee agreement and in particular to any term in the agreement relating to the consequences of such death, incapacity, winding up or dissolution, as the case may be.\n(4) The court may, even if it thinks the conditional fee\nagreement would have been enforceable under section 115D(4) if an application had been made under section 115D(2), order the amount due in respect of anything done under the agreement mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) to be ascertained by assessment.\n(5) The Registrar, in ascertaining by assessment the amount mentioned in subsection (4), must have regard to the terms of the conditional fee agreement and in particular to any term in the agreement relating to the consequences of death or incapacity of\nthe solicitor or foreign lawyer or the winding up or dissolution of the law practice entity (as the case may be) that is a party to the conditional fee agreement.\n(6) Payment of the amount found to be due may be enforced in the same manner as if the conditional fee agreement had been\ncompletely performed by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity, as the case may be.\nChange of solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity after conditional fee agreement 115F.\u2014(1) If, after a conditional fee agreement has been\nentered into, the client changes the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity acting for the client before the conclusion of the prescribed proceedings to which the agreement relates (which the client may do despite the agreement), an application may be made to the court by any party thereto or by the\nrepresentatives of that party.\n(2) The court has, upon the application under subsection (1), the same power to enforce or set aside the agreement, so far as it may have been acted upon, as if the change of solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity had not occurred and in exercising\nsuch power the court must have regard to the terms of the conditional fee agreement and in particular to any term in the agreement relating to the consequences of a change in or the death or incapacity of the solicitor or foreign lawyer or of the winding up or dissolution of the law practice entity, as the case\nmay be.\n(3) The court may, even if it thinks the conditional fee agreement would have been enforceable under section 115D(4) if an application had been made under section 115D(2), order the amount due in respect of anything done to be ascertained by\nassessment.\n(4) The Registrar, in ascertaining by assessment the amount due in respect of the proceedings conducted or work done, must have regard to \u2014\n(a) the circumstances under which the change mentioned\nin subsection (1) took place; and\n(b) the terms of the conditional fee agreement and in particular any term in the agreement relating to the consequences of a change in or the death or incapacity of the solicitor or foreign lawyer or of the winding up\nor dissolution of the law practice entity, as the case may be.\n(5) Upon an assessment mentioned in subsection (4), the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity is not entitled to the full amount of the remuneration or costs agreed to be paid\nunless it appears that there has been no default, negligence, improper delay or other conduct on the part of the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity affording reasonable ground to the client for the change of solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity, as the case may be.\n(6) Payment of the amount found to be due may be enforced in the same manner as if the conditional fee agreement had been completely performed by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity, as the case may be.\".\nMiscellaneous amendment\n7. The principal Act is amended by deleting the words \"the prescribed date\" wherever they appear in the following provisions and substituting in each case the words \"18 November 2015\":\nSection 36I(9) and (10)\nSection 174(4), (5), (6) and (7)\nSection 175(4) and (5)\nSection 176(4), (6), (11) and (13)\nSection 177(10) and (11)\nSection 178(7)\nSection 179(9) and (10).\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act to provide a framework for conditional fee agreements (CFAs) between lawyers and law practices on the one hand and their clients on the other hand in relation to legal services in certain dispute resolution proceedings. The framework will apply to the same category of lawyers and law practice entities as that in Part 8 of the Legal Profession Act, i.e., Singapore lawyers and Singapore law practices, whether for the practice of\nSingapore or foreign law, as well as certain registered foreign lawyers and foreign law practices.\nA CFA (defined in the new section 115A) is an agreement which provides for the whole or part of remuneration and costs in dispute resolution proceedings (whether in or outside Singapore) to be payable only in specified circumstances, and which may also provide for an \"uplift fee\". Examples of \"specified circumstances\" are where the client succeeds in his or her claim or where certain agreed outcomes are achieved in the proceedings. An \"uplift fee\" is defined to mean the remuneration or costs which the CFA provides are payable in specified circumstances which are higher than the remuneration or costs that would otherwise be payable if there were no CFA. The \"uplift fee\" may also be determined (without limitation) by reference to differences between the gross sum or hourly rates of remuneration or costs payable in specified circumstances, and the sum or rates that are chargeable if there were no CFA. The word \"costs\" as defined in section 2(1) includes fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration. A CFA is different from the type of fee agreement where the remuneration or costs are payable as a percentage or proportion of the amount of damages awarded to or recovered by the client, and which continues to be prohibited.\nThe Bill also amends the Act to require a foreign lawyer with full registration to seek the permission of the court to carry out certain acts in proceedings before the\nSingapore International Commercial Court (called the SICC), or in an appeal against a judgment of the SICC, and to prohibit him or her from submitting on a matter of Singapore law in such proceedings or appeal.\nFinally, the Bill clarifies the date on which various provisions of the Act were operationalised.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 36P which allows a foreign lawyer with full registration to appear in prescribed proceedings before the SICC or in a prescribed appeal to an appellate court against a judgment or an order of the SICC. The effect of the amendment is that, in certain proceedings or appeals to be prescribed by rules, the foreign lawyer \u2014\n(a) must obtain the permission of the SICC or the appellate court in order to plead any matter in the prescribed proceedings or appeals; and\n(b) must not make a submission on a matter of Singapore law.\nRules may provide exceptions to paragraph (a) or (b), and also prescribe factors that the court may consider in deciding whether to grant permission under paragraph (a).\nClause 3 amends section 107 to clarify that the prohibition of certain agreements and stipulations in that section does not prevent a solicitor from entering into a CFA that complies with the new Part 8A to be inserted by clause 6.\nA fee agreement where the remuneration or costs are payable as a percentage or proportion of the amount of damages awarded or recovered, however, remains prohibited by section 107.\nClause 4 amends section 111 to carve out a CFA that complies with the new\nPart 8A from the scope of costs agreements for contentious business permitted by that section. The term \"contentious business\" as defined in section 2(1) means \"business done in or for the purposes of proceedings begun before a court of justice or before an arbitrator\". Consequently, sections 112 to 115 in Part 8 will not apply to a CFA. Section 107 will also continue to apply to CFAs that do not conform with the new Part 8A. There will therefore be no overlap as the CFAs that comply with the new Part 8A will instead be governed by the new Part 8A.\nClause 5 amends section 113(8) to update the obsolete reference to a committee of person or persons to a reference to a donee or deputy under the Mental Capacity\nAct.\nClause 6 inserts a new Part 8A on CFAs, containing new sections 115A to 115F.\nThe new section 115A sets out the scope and application of the new Part 8A and defines \"conditional fee agreement\", \"contentious proceedings\", \"prescribed proceedings\" and \"uplift fee\" for the purposes of the Part. The new Part 8A will apply to CFAs only in relation to certain contentious proceedings that will be specified in regulations. Contentious proceedings are proceedings before a court of justice or an arbitrator or any other dispute resolution proceedings. As mentioned above, a CFA is an agreement relating to the legal fees in contentious\nproceedings (whether in or outside Singapore) which may provide for an \"uplift fee\" (as explained above). The contentious proceedings in which CFAs may be used are to be specified in regulations made under the new section 115B(7) and called \"prescribed proceedings\". The new Part 8Awill apply to the same category of lawyers and law practices as that in the existing Part 8, i.e., Singapore lawyers and Singapore law practices whether they are practising Singapore or foreign law, as well as certain registered foreign lawyers and foreign law practices that are regulated or licensed in Singapore. These persons and entities are collectively referred to in the new Part 8A as \"a solicitor, a foreign lawyer or a law practice entity\".\nThe new section 115B expressly permits the making of a CFA in relation to remuneration or costs in prescribed proceedings. Where the requirements mentioned in the new section 115B(4) are complied with in relation to a conditional fee agreement, the agreement is (a) not unenforceable by reason only of its being a conditional fee agreement; and (b) not contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal, by reason only that it is a contract for maintenance or champerty.\nThe consequences if these requirements are not complied with are set out in the new section 115D. The new section 115B(4) provides that the CFA must be in writing and signed by the client, must not provide for remuneration or costs based on a percentage or proportion of the damages or other amounts awarded or recovered, and satisfy other requirements specified in the regulations, which the\nMinister is empowered to make under the new section 115B(7). The new section 115B(6) seeks to avoid doubt that a CFA may provide for remuneration or costs incurred in relation to preliminary and preparatory advice and other legal services for the purposes of and before the commencement of any contemplated prescribed proceedings and negotiations or settlement of a claim or dispute, even if those proceedings are eventually not commenced or if the claim or dispute in those proceedings is settled. The new section 115B(5) is adapted from the existing section 112(5). Under the new section 115B(8), Rules of Court may be made to provide for the assessment of any remuneration or costs payable under a CFA and the procedure and practice of applications made under the new Part 8A. The new section 115B(10) provides that any addition to or deletion or variation of the requirements of a CFA under the new section 115B(4) by regulations made under the new section 115B(7) will apply prospectively to CFAs entered into on or after the date of the addition, deletion or variation.\nThe new section 115C provides for the effect of a CFA on legal costs. The new section 115C(1) clarifies that a CFA does not affect the recovery of costs from the client by a person who is not the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that conducted the proceedings for the client, and costs payable to the client by such person, and such costs may be assessed, unless otherwise agreed. This would for example include party and party costs which the client may recover from the losing party or a third party in the court proceedings. The new section 115C(2) has the effect that if the CFA provides for payment of an uplift fee, the amount of uplift\nfee cannot be recovered as party and party costs by the client against the losing party. The client can only recover from the other party the amount of costs as if there had been no CFA. The new section 115C(3) provides that the client cannot recover from the other party more than the amount paid by the client to the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity that conducted the proceedings for the client. The new section 115C(4) provides that it is an implied term of a CFA that no claim for remuneration and costs may be made on a separate basis from the\nCFA by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity except where expressly provided in the CFA. The new section 115C(5) provides that where there is a CFA in place, the costs of a solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity are not subject to assessment nor to section 118, subject to the provisions of the new\nPart 8A.\nThe new section 115D provides for the enforcement of CFAs and the determination of questions relating to the validity or effect of a CFA. An action or a suit cannot be brought or instituted upon any CFA except for an application made under the new Part 8A. Instead, an application may be made to the court (which includes a court other than the General Division of the High Court) in which the contentious proceedings were conducted. If the contentious proceedings were not conducted in any court, then the application may be made to the General\nDivision of the High Court. If the court finds that the requirements in the new section 115B(4) are complied with and that the CFA is neither void nor voidable under the common law principles of contract having regard to the circumstances in which the CFAwas made and the interests of all the parties to the agreement taken as a whole, the court may enforce it in any manner and subject to any conditions that the court may think fit. If the court does not make such findings, the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity cannot recover any amount more than the amount that would have been recoverable if the CFA had not been unenforceable.\nAny excess amount received must be repaid. The amounts not in excess may be recoverable on assessment by the court as if the CFA had not been made.\nThe new section 115D(7) provides that within 12 months after the amount agreed under the CFA has been paid, an application may be made to the court. The court may, if the special circumstances of the case so require, reopen the CFA, order that the remuneration and costs be assessed or order the whole or any portion of the amount received by the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity to be repaid. The new section 115D(8) provides that where a CFA is entered into by a client in the capacity of a guardian or donee or deputy of a person who lacks capacity or as a trustee under a deed or will and the estate or property of the beneficiary or person who lacks capacity will be chargeable with the amount payable under the CFA, the CFA must be laid before the Registrar of the Supreme\nCourt (the Registrar) before payment. If payment is made without the approval of the Registrar or the General Division of the High Court, the client is liable to account to the person whose estate or property is charged, and the solicitor, foreign\nlawyer or law practice entity that accepted the payment may be ordered by the court to refund the payment received.\nThe new section 115E provides for the consequences of the death or incapacity of the solicitor or foreign lawyer or the winding up or dissolution of the law practice entity after the CFA had been made. If this occurs, an application may be made to the court. The court has the same power to enforce or set aside the CFA, so far as it has been acted upon, as if the death, incapacity, winding up or dissolution had not occurred. In exercising such power, the court must have regard to the terms of the CFA, in particular to any term relating to the consequences of death, incapacity, winding up or dissolution of the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity, as the case may be. If the court orders the amount due in respect of the CFA to be ascertained by assessment, the assessing Registrar must also have regard to any such terms.\nThe new section 115F provides for the consequences where after a CFA has been made, the client changes the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity acting for the client before the conclusion of the prescribed proceedings. If this occurs, an application may be made to the court. The court has the same power to enforce or set aside the CFA, so far as it has been acted upon, as if the change of solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity had not occurred. Similar to the new section 115E, the court must have regard to the terms of the CFA, in particular to any term relating to the consequences of a change in, death, incapacity, winding up or dissolution of the solicitor, foreign lawyer or law practice entity, as the case may\nbe.\nClause 7 replaces the term \"the prescribed date\" in various provisions with \"18 November 2015\", which is the date those provisions were operationalised.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The clause also amends subsection (7) to provide that the subsection is subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as the Board may impose and inserts new subsections (8) and (9).\nThe new subsection (8) provides that, where the Board is satisfied that a member of the Home Protection Insurance Scheme is not a citizen or permanent resident of Singapore, that member's cover is deemed to be terminated at the prescribed time.\nThe new subsection (9) provides that the time prescribed for termination may differ for different classes of members.\nClause 19 amends section 77(1) to include references to section 13(7B), (7E) and (7F) in paragraph (ba) and to clarify in paragraph (s) that regulations may be made to prescribe anything that is required or permitted to be prescribed by regulations made under the Act.\nPART 2\nClause 20 amends section 25 by deleting subsection (6A) as consent to disclosure of information after death will no longer be required.\nClause 21 amends section 59 by inserting new subsections (10) and (11) to allow the Board to disclose, after being notified of a member's death, certain information about the deceased member (specified in the new subsection (11)) to the member's nominees, the persons who would be the member's beneficiaries under section 25A(1) on the assumption that a nomination was not made by the deceased member under section 25(1) or other prescribed persons.\nPART 3\nClause 22 replaces section 2(6) to construe a reference to the amount payable on a member's death out of the Fund as a reference to the balance standing to the credit of a member in the Fund as computed from time to time by the Board after it is notified of a member's death, taking into account anything done under the new section 75 inserted by clause 30.\nClause 23 amends section 19D(3)(b) such that the provision applies where the\nBoard has been notified that the payer has died.\nClause 24 amends section 20(1)(b) such that the provision applies where the\nBoard has been notified that the member has died.\nClause 25 amends section 24(3A) to make a consequential amendment to refer to the new section 75. The clause also amends subsections (3A) and (3B) to refer to moneys paid out of the Fund both on or after the death of a member.\nClause 26 amends section 25(4A) such that the provision applies where the\nBoard has been notified that a nominated person has died.\nClause 27 replaces section 27B(1)(a)(ii)(A) and (b)(i) such that the payment to the spouse is to take place after the Board has been notified that the member has died, if the member was not entitled to withdraw the sum standing to the credit of the member under section 15(2), 15AA(1) or 27 prior to the member's death.\nClause 28 amends section 27Q(2)(h) to clarify that the refund of the premium is on account of the death of the member. The regulations may therefore provide for the refund to be made on or after the member's death or notification of the member's death.\nClause 29 amends section 57C(4), (5) and (6) to clarify that the Board may exercise its powers under those subsections on or after the death of the eligible member or member of the Fund.\nClause 30 inserts a new section 75, which relates to transactions by the Board under the Act, the CareShield Life and Long\u2010Term Care Act 2019 or the\nMediShield Life Scheme Act 2015 after a member's death. Subsection (1) clarifies that the Board may, before being notified of a member's death, do anything under those Acts as if the member has not died. Subsection (2) empowers the Board to do certain things under those Acts as if the member has not died even after being notified of the member's death. Subsection (3) empowers the Board to reverse an act done by the Board (whether before, on or after the date of commencement of the new section 75) on or after the member's death as if the member has not died to the extent that it is expedient, and grants immunity to the\nBoard in relation to such acts. Subsection (4) validates acts done by the Board before the new section 75 comes into force which would be permitted under the new section 75(1), (2) or (3) if done when those new provisions come into force, and grants immunity to the Board in relation to such acts. Subsection (5) clarifies that subsections (1) to (4) do not affect any recourse a person may have against another person to whom the Board has paid money or transferred designated shares. Subsection (6) clarifies that the new section 75 does not prevent the Board or any person from carrying out a transaction on or after the member's death under any written law or rule of law. Subsection (7) defines certain terms used in the section.\nPART 4\nClause 31 amends section 62(1) and replaces subsection (8) to permit the\nBoard to determine the form of a notice to attend court, instead of using a prescribed notice.\nClause 32 amends section 62A to provide that a notice to attend court or summons may be served by transmitting it to an electronic mail address if certain requirements with respect to consent are satisfied or by serving it through the electronic service platform mentioned in section 74 with the person's consent if so provided by regulations made for the purposes of section 74(4)(b).\nClause 33 inserts a new section 74 to provide for the Board's electronic service platform for the service of documents required or permitted to be served under the\nAct on persons who have been assigned an account by the Board. The clause also provides that regulations may be made in relation to the procedure for the use of the platform and safeguards relating to service through the platform with the\nmember's consent, or with notice of the Board's intention of service through the platform if the person does not refuse such service.\nClause 34 amends section 77(1) by inserting a new paragraph (r) to allow regulations to be made to provide for service by any means (other than under sections 62A and 74) of any document required or permitted to be served under the\nAct, except a notice to attend court or a summons mentioned in section 62A and any document to be served in proceedings in court. Section 62A governs the service of notice to attend court and summons and section 74 governs the service of documents by the electronic service platform.\nPART 5\nClause 35 provides saving and transitional provisions for Part 1 of the Bill.\nClause 35(1) deems every application for withdrawal on the grounds of section 15(2)(b) or (c) as in force before the date of commencement of clause 5 to be an application for withdrawal on the grounds of the new section 15(2)(b).\nThis applies to applications pending on that date or received by the Board on or after that date. Clause 35(2) provides that clause 12 does not affect the validity of any nomination made before the date of commencement of that clause.\nClause 36 provides saving and transitional provisions for Part 2 of the Bill.\nClause 36(1) provides that where the Board has been notified of the member's death before the date of commencement of clause 21, the deceased member's consent (if still in force immediately before that date) will continue to apply instead of the new section 59(10) and (11). Clause 36(2) provides that the Board can disclose such information under the new section 59(10) and (11) where the\nBoard is notified of the member's death on or after the date of commencement of clause 21, whenever the member died and whether or not any consent has been given under section 25(6A). Clause 36(3) deems that the member's consent for the disclosure of information by the Board given under section 25(6A) and that is in force immediately before the date of commencement of clause 20 is revoked with effect from that date where the Board has not been notified of the member's death before that date.\nClause 37 empowers the Minister to make regulations to prescribe additional provisions of a saving or transitional nature for any provision of the Bill for a period of 2 years after the date of commencement of any provision of the Bill.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

CORENET X will be launched progressively, and new features and projects will be onboarded in phases to ensure a smooth transition.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nPART 1\nBUILDING CONTROL ACT 1989\nClause 2 amends section 2(1) to update certain definitions in light of the new section 5AA, which deems plans of certain prescribed building works as approved by the Commissioner of Building Control (called the Commissioner), if (among other conditions) those plans have been lodged with the Commissioner.\nClause 3 amends section 5A to introduce a new subsection (2)(aa) and (d), to align the requirements for an application for approval of amended building plans under that section with the requirements for an application for approval of original building plans under section 5.\nClause 4 inserts 2 new sections to establish a new lodgment framework for certain classes of building works to be prescribed in regulations (called lodgment works). Plans of lodgment works are deemed approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of the Act if certain conditions are satisfied.\nThe new section 5AA allows developers of lodgment works to lodge the plans of those works with the Commissioner as an alternative to applying under section 5 for approval of the plans. The lodged plans are deemed approved by the\nCommissioner if they comply with certain requirements in the regulations (called building regulation requirements) and the Commissioner has issued a written acknowledgment of the lodgment. As there is no manual approval process, the developer has to ensure that the lodged plans are compliant with the building regulation requirements. A developer who lodges non-compliant plans may be required by the Commissioner to apply for approval of the plans under section 5, instead of lodging the plans again with the Commissioner.\nThe new section 5AB requires a developer to obtain approval for any departure or deviation from plans of lodgment works that are deemed approved under the new section 5AA. The developer can do so by lodging the plans of the proposed departure or deviation under the new section 5AA and complying with the other conditions for the deemed approval of the amended plans, or applying for approval of those plans for the proposed departure or deviation under section 5. If the proposed departure or deviation results in the building works no longer being lodgment works, the developer must apply under section 5 for approval of the plans of the proposed departure or deviation.\nClause 5 amends section 5B(1) to provide for the automatic lapsing of a deemed approval of the plans of lodgment works under certain circumstances.\nClause 6 amends section 9 to apply certain duties of a qualified person to plans that are deemed approved under the new section 5AA. These include the duty of a qualified person appointed to prepare plans of any building works to supply a copy of the deemed approved plans to the site supervisor and other persons, and the duty\nof a qualified person appointed to supervise the carrying out of any building works to take reasonable steps and exercise due diligence when carrying out his or her duties to ensure that the works are carried out in accordance with the deemed approved plans.\nClause 7 amends section 11 to apply certain duties of a builder to plans that are deemed approved under the new section 5AA. These include the duties of a builder undertaking building works to ensure that the works are carried out in accordance with deemed approved plans, and to keep those plans at the premises on which the works are carried out and to make them available on request by a specialist builder, and the duty of a specialist builder undertaking specialist building works to ensure that the works are carried out in accordance with the deemed approved plans.\nClause 8 amends section 20 for the following purposes:\n(a) to make it an offence for a person to commence or carry out, or to permit or authorise the commencement or carrying out of, any building works the plans of which have not been approved or deemed approved by the Commissioner. However, it is a defence in the case of any lodgment works the plans of which have been lodged under the new section 5AA but which do not comply with a building regulation requirement, that the accused reasonably believed that such requirement had been complied with;\n(b) to make it an offence for a person who, when carrying out any lodgment works, deviated in a material way from the plans for those works that are deemed approved, or permitted or authorised such deviation.\nClause 9 amends section 22 to allow an appeal to be made to the Minister against a decision of the Commissioner requiring a developer who lodges non-compliant plans to apply for approval of the plans under section 5, instead of lodging the plans again with the Commissioner.\nClause 10 inserts a new section 42AA to empower the Commissioner to permit an application or lodgment under the Act to be made using a prescribed electronic service administered by a public authority to facilitate the sending of documents in connection with building works under the Act and other written laws.\nClause 11 amends section 43A to expand the offence of making or producing false documents to the Commissioner, to include documents being made or produced for the purpose of lodgment with the Commissioner under the new section 5AA.\nClause 12 amends section 49 to enable certain matters to be prescribed in regulations, including the minimum or maximum number of qualified persons\nrequired or permitted to prepare the plans of any description of building works, and the manner of lodging plans under the new section 5AA.\nPART 2\nAND MANAGEMENT ACT 1999\nClause 13 amends section 2 to make more precise the definition of \"building works\" and to delete the definition of \"qualified person\" as it is no longer needed with the repeal of section 33.\nClause 14 amends the heading of Part 9 in light of the repeal of section 33, the substance of which is dealt with under the new Part 9A, as inserted by clause 16.\nClause 15 amends section 32 to provide that the provisions on licences in that section do not apply to certificates issued under the new Part 9A, as inserted by clause 16.\nClause 16 replaces section 33 with a new Part 9A consisting of 15 new sections. The subject of section 33 is dealt with under the new Part.\nThe new Part 9A establishes a framework for the Director-General of\nEnvironmental Protection (called the Director-General) to regulate building works and industrial plant works (collectively called controlled works), to ensure that the plans for such works comply with pollution control requirements. This framework is an expansion of the existing section 33, which subjects only industrial plant works to pollution control requirements.\nThe new section 33 sets out various definitions used in the new Part 9A.\nThe new section 33A sets out the purpose of the new Part 9A. It also clarifies that the new Part 9A does not limit the operation of other written laws relating to the regulation of controlled works, for example, the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 33B prohibits the carrying out of any controlled works without a clearance certificate issued by the Director-General.\nThe new section 33C empowers the making of regulations to exempt from the new section 33B (with or without conditions) any class of controlled works for any buildings or industrial plants that have been assessed to pose a low risk of pollution to the environment. The conditions may include requiring plans of exempt works to be lodged with the Director-General.\nThe new section 33D sets out the matters governing an application for a clearance certificate, which the Director-General may issue if the plans of the controlled works comply with pollution control requirements.\nThe new section 33E creates an optional process in respect of controlled works.\nThe developer of the controlled works may, if the developer intends to carry out\nany site formation works or other prescribed works, apply to the Director-General for early clearance of the key design parameters of the controlled works. If the key design parameters comply with pollution control requirements, the\nDirector-General may issue a design certificate authorising the developer to carry out the site formation works or other prescribed works, pending any application for or issuance of a clearance certificate.\nThe new section 33F provides that the issuance of a design certificate or clearance certificate is subject to the requirement under section 26A of the Energy\nConservation Act 2012 (if it applies) that the Director-General must approve the report of the energy efficiency opportunities assessment to be conducted under that section.\nThe new section 33G requires a developer of controlled works to apply for a new clearance certificate under the new section 33D if the developer intends to depart or deviate from any plans of those works for which a clearance certificate was previously issued. This provision is similar to the requirement in section 5A of the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 33H makes it an offence for a person to carry out any controlled works that deviate from the plans of those works for which a clearance certificate has been issued. This provision is similar to section 20(3) and (4) of the\nBuilding Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 33I requires a developer who has obtained a clearance certificate for the plans of controlled works to apply to the Director-General for a compliance certificate upon the completion of the works, to certify that the works have been completed in accordance with the plans and the conditions (if any) in the clearance certificate.\nThe new section 33J empowers the Director-General to issue a temporary compliance certificate in the first instance where an application for a compliance certificate is made in respect of completed controlled works. The Director-General may issue the temporary compliance certificate if he or she considers that the building that is the subject of the works or in relation to which the works are done has substantially complied with pollution control requirements such that it is suitable for occupation. However, the actual occupation of the building would still be subject to the issuance of a temporary occupation permit or certificate of statutory completion under the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 33K imposes penalties for providing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining any certificate under the new Part 9A. It also empowers the Director-General to revoke any certificate if he or she is satisfied that false or misleading information has been provided for the purpose of obtaining the certificate.\nThe new section 33L creates a procedure for appeals to the Minister against decisions of the Director-General under the new Part 9A to disapprove an\napplication, impose conditions on the grant of a certificate, or revoke any certificate.\nThe new section 33M empowers the Minister to designate a political office-holder or a public officer, in his or her Ministry, to hear and determine any appeals under the new section 33L in the Minister's place.\nThe new section 33N empowers the Director-General to permit applications and lodgments under or for the purposes of the new Part 9A to be made using the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building Control\nAct 1989, as inserted by clause 10.\nClause 17 amends the Third Schedule to introduce new matters which may be prescribed in regulations to support the new Part 9A, as inserted by clause 16.\nPART 3\nENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH ACT 1987\nClause 18 inserts a new Part 5A consisting of 15 new sections.\nThe new Part 5A establishes a framework for the Director-General of Public\nHealth (called the Director-General) to regulate building works and works involving the installation, extension or alteration of certain facilities (collectively called controlled works), to ensure that such works comply with environmental public health requirements. This is similar in structure to the framework in the new\nPart 9A of the Environmental Protection and Management Act 1999, as inserted by clause 16.\nThe new section 46A sets out various definitions used in the new Part 5A.\nThe new section 46B sets out the purpose of the new Part 5A. It also clarifies that the new Part 5A does not limit the operation of other written laws relating to the regulation of controlled works, for example, the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 46C prohibits the carrying out of any controlled works without a clearance certificate issued by the Director-General.\nThe new section 46D empowers the making of regulations to exempt from the new section 46C (with or without conditions) any class of controlled works of any buildings or facilities that have been assessed to pose a low risk of giving rise to the spread of any infectious disease or of harbouring conditions injurious or dangerous to public health. The conditions may include requiring plans of such exempt works to be lodged with the Director-General.\nThe new section 46E sets out the matters governing an application for a clearance certificate, which the Director-General may issue if the plans of the controlled works comply with environmental public health requirements.\nThe new section 46F creates an optional process in respect of controlled works.\nThe developer of the controlled works may, if the developer intends to carry out any site formation works or other prescribed works, apply to the Director-General for early clearance of the key design parameters of the works. If the key design parameters comply with environmental public health requirements, the\nDirector-General may issue a design certificate authorising the developer to carry out site formation works or other prescribed works, pending any application for or issuance of a clearance certificate.\nThe new section 46G requires a developer of controlled works to apply for a new clearance certificate under the new section 46E if the developer intends to depart or deviate from any plans of those works for which a clearance certificate was previously issued. This provision is similar to the requirement in section 5A of the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 46H makes it an offence for a person to carry out any controlled works that deviate from the plans of those works for which a clearance certificate has been issued. This provision is similar to section 20(3) and (4) of the\nBuilding Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 46I requires a developer who has obtained a clearance certificate for the plans of controlled works to apply to the Director-General for a compliance certificate upon the completion of the works, to certify that the works have been completed in accordance with the plans and the conditions (if any) in the clearance certificate.\nThe new section 46J empowers the Director-General to issue a temporary compliance certificate in the first instance where an application for a compliance certificate is made in respect of completed controlled works. The Director-General may issue the temporary compliance certificate if he or she considers that the building that is the subject of the works or in relation to which the works are done has substantially complied with environmental public health requirements such that it is suitable for occupation. However, the actual occupation of the building would still be subject to the issuance of a temporary occupation permit or certificate of statutory completion under the Building Control Act 1989.\nThe new section 46K imposes penalties for providing false or misleading information for the purpose of obtaining any certificate under the new Part 5A. It also empowers the Director-General to revoke any certificate if he or she is satisfied that false or misleading information has been provided for the purpose of obtaining the certificate.\nThe new section 46L creates a procedure for appeals to the Minister against decisions of the Director-General under the new Part 5A to disapprove an application, impose conditions on the grant of a certificate, or revoke any certificate.\nThe new section 46M empowers the Minister to designate a political office-holder or a public officer, in his or her Ministry, to hear and determine any appeals under the new section 46L in the Minister's place.\nThe new section 46N empowers the Director-General to permit applications and lodgments under or for the purposes of the new Part 5A to be made using the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building Control\nAct 1989, as inserted by clause 10.\nThe new section 46O provides for the registration of registered inspectors for the purposes of the new Part 5A, and allows regulations to be made to provide for the appointment and duties of registered inspectors. A registered inspector may be appointed by a developer to inspect any completed controlled works for the purposes of an application for a compliance certificate under the new section 46I.\nThis provision is similar to section 34 of the Environmental Protection and\nManagement Act 1999.\nClause 19 amends section 99 to provide that the provisions on licences in that section do not apply to certificates issued under the new Part 5A, as inserted by clause 18.\nClause 20 amends the Third Schedule to introduce new matters which may be prescribed in regulations to support the new Part 5A, as inserted by clause 18.\nPART 4\nAMENDMENT OF FIRE SAFETY ACT 1993\nClause 21 inserts a new section 99A, which empowers the Commissioner of\nCivil Defence to permit applications under Part 4 to be made using the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building Control Act 1989, as inserted by clause 10.\nPART 5\nAMENDMENT OF PARKS AND TREES ACT 2005\nClause 22 inserts a new section 59A, which empowers the Commissioner of\nParks and Recreation to permit applications under the Act and regulations, for any matter connected with building works, to be made using the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building Control Act 1989, as inserted by clause 10.\nPART 6\nAMENDMENT OF PLANNING ACT 1998\nClause 23 amends the definition of \"provisional permission\" in section 2 to include a provisional permission granted under the new section 17A, as inserted by clause 25.\nClause 24 amends section 17 to replace the term \"final permission\" with \"written permission\". This amendment does not alter the substance of section 17 as a final permission simply means a written permission granted after an initial grant of provisional permission under section 17(1). The amendment seeks to standardise all references to written permission in the Act regardless of whether such written permission is granted in the first instance or after a grant of provisional permission.\nClause 25 introduces a new section 17A to enable applications for provisional permission. The new section allows applicants for planning permission or conservation permission to apply to the competent authority for early clearance of the key design parameters of the development or works to be carried out, so the applicants can commence preliminary works before making an application for written permission (which necessarily involves more detail and thus requires more time and effort to prepare).\nClause 26 deletes section 20(1)(b) which refers to a final permission granted under section 17(4). Section 20(1)(b) is no longer necessary in light of the amendment to section 17 to replace the term \"final permission\" with \"written permission\".\nClause 27 introduces a new section 52A to empower the competent authority to permit applications, lodgments and submissions under the Act to be made using the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building Control\nAct 1989, as inserted by clause 10.\nPART 7\nAMENDMENT OF WILDLIFE ACT 1965\nClause 28 inserts a new section 19A. The new section applies when a person has used the electronic service described in the new section 42AA of the Building\nControl Act 1989 (inserted by clause 10), to make an application under section 5 or 5A, or a lodgment under the new section 5AA, of the Building Control\nAct 1989. The Director-General, Wildlife Management may serve on the person a direction under section 10(1) of the Wildlife Act 1965 using the electronic service.\nPART 8\nClause 29 makes various amendments to the Amusement Rides Safety\nAct 2011 that are consequential to the new section 5AA of the Building Control\nAct 1989, as inserted by clause 4.\nClause 30 makes various amendments to the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act 2004 that are consequential to the new section 5AA of the\nBuilding Control Act 1989, as inserted by clause 4.\nClause 31 amends section 26A of the Energy Conservation Act 2012, by extending the obligations in section 26A(1)(a) and (b) (if applicable) to conduct an energy efficiency opportunities assessment and submitting a report of the assessment to the Director-General of Environmental Protection, before making an application for a design certificate under the Environmental Protection and\nManagement Act 1999. This amendment is consequential to the new section 33F in the Environmental Protection and Management Act 1999, as inserted by clause 16.\nClause 32 makes amendments to sections 2, 8 and 26 of the Land Betterment\nCharge Act 2021 that are consequential to amendments made to the Planning\nAct 1998 under Part 6.\nClause 33 provides for saving and transitional provisions.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The clause contains definitions of terms used in several Parts of the Bill.\nA \"foreign employee\" is defined to mean a foreigner who seeks employment, or is employed to work, in Singapore but excludes a self\u2010employed foreigner. The term also includes a foreigner whose employment in Singapore has expired or has been terminated (whether or not for justified reasons) and is authorised under the\nImmigration Act (Cap. 133) to remain in Singapore. An example of foreigners in the latter group are those whose work passes have been cancelled but are granted a special pass to stay on in Singapore to pursue claims for compensation or salary.\nA \"proprietor\" of boarding premises is defined to include the lessor or grantor of premises that are leased or the subject of a licence to occupy.\nThe key term \"boarding premises\" is defined to mean premises (or a complex of premises) that provide boarders or lodgers with a principal place of residence, and may have shared facilities (such as a communal living room, bathroom, laundry or kitchen) or services that are provided to boarders or lodgers, and have rooms (some or all of which may have private kitchen or bathroom facilities) that accommodate one or more boarders or lodgers.\nClause 3 defines the premises called a \"foreign employee dormitory\".\nA \"foreign employee dormitory\" is defined to mean any boarding premises that provides 1,000 (the threshold number) beds or higher to residents who are foreign employees, or provides accommodation to 1,000 (the threshold number) residents who are foreign employees. Boarding premises may also be regarded as a foreign employee dormitory if it has the prescribed occupancy load and is providing accommodation substantially to foreign employees.\nHowever, premises that are used as a hotel, an inn, a hostel or a bed and breakfast accommodation, a serviced apartment, premises like a convalescent\nhome or nursing home, student dormitories and residences such as houses, flats and apartments do not come within the meaning of the expression \"foreign employee dormitory\". The Minister has power to exclude more premises from that expression through an order published in the Gazette.\nThe \"threshold number\" of 1,000 may also be replaced with a lower number by the Minister making a notification published in the Gazette.\nClause 4 sets out the purposes of the Bill, which is to provide a regulatory framework for the provision of facilities and amenities, and the delivery of services, to residents of foreign employee dormitories who are foreign employees.\nThe Bill provides for the licensing of operators of foreign employee dormitories, for certain accommodation standards to be observed with respect to the accommodation of residents of foreign employee dormitories and for the appropriate mechanisms for the enforcement of those standards, and seeks to promote the sustainability of, and continuous improvements in, the provision of services at foreign employee dormitories.\nClause 5 explains the interface between the Bill and other existing laws that can apply with respect to operations of a foreign employee dormitory. Essentially, the\nBill is not to operate in a way that derogates from any requirement imposed by or under the Building Control Act (Cap. 29), the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap. 95), the Fire Safety Act (Cap. 109A), the Control of Vectors and Pesticides\nAct (Cap. 59) and the Planning Act (Cap. 232).\nThe Minister may by regulations under clause 34 prescribe other written law with respect to the use of premises as, or the provision of services to residents of foreign employee dormitories that should not be affected by the Bill. This is to reduce or help clarify any overlap in regulatory requirements.\nClause 6 provides for the appointment of a Commissioner, Deputy\nCommissioners for Foreign Employee Dormitories, Assistant Commissioners for Foreign Employee Dormitories and dormitory inspectors.\nPART 2\nPart 2 sets out the framework for licensing of operators of foreign employee dormitories.\nClause 7 makes it an offence for a person to operate any boarding premises as a foreign employee dormitory except under the authority of a licence that relates to those premises. The clause also makes it an offence if a proprietor of boarding premises uses (or permits the use of) the premises as a foreign employee dormitory unless those premises are used as such by a licensed operator holding a valid licence relating to those premises. These are arrestable offences.\nThe penalty is a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $1 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 4 years or to both.\nClause 8 deals with applications for a licence. The Commissioner may, on receiving an application for a licence to operate any boarding premises as a foreign employee dormitory, carry out, or arrange to be carried out by dormitory inspectors, such investigations and inquiries in relation to the application as the\nCommissioner considers necessary for a proper consideration of the application.\nClause 9 deals with the granting of a licence by the Commissioner and the factors that are to be taken into account when doing so.\nClause 10 is concerned with the validity period and form of the licence and its renewal. The clause also provides that a licence does not cease only by reason that the boarding premises to which it relates stops providing beds of the threshold number or accommodation of the threshold number, etc.\nClause 11 deals with conditions of a licence. These conditions may include a requirement to meet standards prescribed in regulations, or specified in the licence in so far as they are not prescribed, relating to services provided to residents (such as standards concerning the physical and mental welfare, social activities, personal protection and meals of residents) and relating to accommodation provided to residents (such as standards concerning bedrooms, bathrooms and other rooms that are occupied or used by residents). Licence conditions may also include requirements for licensed operators to prepare to deal with any public emergency.\nClause 12 empowers the Commissioner to add to, delete or modify the conditions of a licence after observing the process prescribed in the clause.\nClause 13 further empowers the Commissioner to give compliance directives without compensation.\nCompliance directives may be given where the Commissioner considers that the duties imposed by or under the Bill in connection with the management of the business of operating the foreign employee dormitory, or the operations of the foreign employee dormitory, specified in the licensed operator's licence are being carried out in a careless or incompetent manner.\nThe Commissioner may also give a compliance directive if satisfied that the licensed operator has contravened or failed to comply with any condition of the licence, or any code of practice or standard of performance, and that the contravention or non\u2010compliance may be rectified.\nFinally, a compliance directive may also be given if the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe there is such a serious and imminent threat or risk to the safety and health of the residents of any boarding premises specified in a\nlicence that a compliance directive is appropriate or requisite to avoid any actual or imminent occurrence that endangers the safety and health of those residents.\nAlternatively, a compliance directive may be given where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the occurrence within or outside Singapore of any civil unrest, hostilities, war, election or other event (whether or not of a similar kind) may occasion disorder within any boarding premises specified in a licence, or cause feelings of ill\u2010will or hostility between, by or with residents in any boarding premises specified in a licence, and that a compliance directive is appropriate or requisite to prevent disorder or preserve the safety of those residents, or to avoid serious disruptions to the community in the vicinity of any boarding premises specified in a licence.\nThe compliance directive may be given to a licensed operator in respect of any boarding premises specified in its licence or a proprietor in cases where compliance by the licensed operator with the compliance directive requires the permission or other co\u2010operation of that proprietor.\nIt is not necessary to provide a licensed operator or proprietor reasonable opportunity to be heard before giving the licensed operator or proprietor a compliance directive.\nA compliance directive may require the licensed operator concerned or the proprietor (according to the circumstances of the case) to do, or to refrain from doing, such things as are specified in the directive or are of a description as specified therein. Non\u2010compliance with a compliance directive is an offence. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $10,000 for each day or part thereof that continues after conviction.\nClause 14 sets out the various regulatory actions that the Commissioner can take against a licensed operator of a foreign employee dormitory if the\nCommissioner is satisfied that \u2014\n(a) the licensed operator is contravening or not complying with, or has contravened or failed to comply with any of the conditions of its licence or any code of practice or standard of performance applicable to the licensed operator, or any provision of the Bill applicable to the licensed operator, whether or not the licensed operator has been convicted of an offence for the contravention or non\u2010compliance;\n(b) the continued use of the boarding premises as a foreign employee dormitory under the licence would constitute an unacceptable risk to the safety, welfare or well\u2010being of residents at those premises;\n(c) the licensed operator has not complied with any compliance directive or a business restriction directive, whether or not the licensed operator has\nbeen convicted of an offence under clause 13(6) or 15(3), as the case may be;\n(d) the licensed operator has gone or is likely to go into compulsory or voluntary liquidation other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction;\n(e) the licensed operator has made any assignment to, or composition with, its creditors; or\n(f) the public interest or security of Singapore requires.\nThe Commissioner may in serious cases, after observing the prescribed process in the clause, revoke a licence. In lieu of revoking the licence, the Commissioner can impose one or more of the following:\n(a) issue a letter of censure;\n(b) add, delete or modify a condition of a licence;\n(c) impose a business restriction directive restricting the licensed operator's business of operating a foreign employee dormitory specified in the licence;\n(d) require a performance bond, guarantee or other form of security to be furnished;\n(e) suspend (for not more than 6 months) the licence without any compensation;\n(f) forfeit the whole or part of any performance bond, guarantee or other form of security provided.\nClause 15 expands on what may be set out in a business restriction directive.\nThis can include a direction to the licensed operator concerned not to enter into an occupancy agreement for the purpose of a foreign employee becoming a resident of the foreign employee dormitory, or not to enter into, or renew or extend, an occupancy agreement.\nAny licensed operator who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes or fails to comply with a requirement imposed by a business restriction directive is guilty of an offence. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\nClause 16 is a debarment provision. The clause states that where a licence to operate boarding premises as a foreign employee dormitory is revoked under clause 14, the person who was the holder of that licence is also disqualified, for such period as may be specified by the Commissioner, from holding a licence for the same premises or such other premises as the Commissioner is to specify in the order, and from being a manager of those premises as a foreign employee dormitory or any foreign employee dormitory.\nClause 17 provides that a licence is not transferable and is not assignable, except with the consent of the Commissioner and that any transfer or assignment, or purported transfer or assignment, of a licence without that approval is of no effect.\nClause 18 imposes a reporting requirement on licensed operators.\nClause 19 empowers the Commissioner to issue or approve codes of practice and standards of performance for licensed operators to adhere to.\nClause 20 provides that no boarding premises are to wholly stop being used as a foreign employee dormitory, and no licence is to be surrendered, unless the licensed operator of the foreign employee dormitory has the approval of the\nCommissioner to do so.\nIn granting any approval, the Commissioner may impose conditions, including but not limited to directing the licensed operator to assist affected residents to find alternative accommodation in Singapore. Non\u2010compliance with the requirements of this clause is an offence.\nClause 21 requires the Commissioner to establish and maintain a Register of all licensed operators.\nPART 3\nClause 22 prescribes an avenue of appeal to the Minister against any decision of the Commissioner to revoke a licence.\nClause 23 allows the Minister to delegate the hearing of appeals to a Minister of\nState, Parliamentary Secretary or public officer in his or her Ministry.\nPART 4\nClause 24 confers various powers of inspection and entry on a dormitory inspector for the purposes of monitoring compliance or investigating any offence under the Bill or any contravention of a provision of the Bill which may result in regulatory action.\nClause 25 provides that a police officer or a dormitory inspector may arrest without warrant any individual whom the police officer or dormitory inspector, as the case may be, reasonably suspects is committing or has committed an offence under clause 7, or an abetment of, or a conspiracy or an attempt to commit, such an offence. Sections 21A to 21G of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap. 91A) can apply, with the necessary modifications, to an arrest by a dormitory inspector under this clause for or in relation to an offence.\nClause 26 sets out offences of giving false information and of obstructing dormitory inspectors in the administration of the Bill.\nClause 27 relates to corporate offenders.\nClause 28 empowers the Commissioner to compound any offence under the Bill which is prescribed as a compoundable offence. The maximum composition sum that may be collected from the person reasonably suspected of having committed the compoundable offence is one half of the amount of the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence or $5,000, whichever is the lower.\nPART 5\nClause 29 deems every foreign employee dormitory to be a public place for the purposes of section 18 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance)\nAct (Cap. 184). That provision sets out the offence of drunkenness in public places.\nClause 30 deals with how documents may be served under the Bill.\nClause 31 is an immunity provision for persons who administer the Bill. The clause provides that no suit or other legal proceedings will lie against the\nCommissioner and any dormitory inspector for anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in the execution or purported execution of the Bill.\nHowever, the immunity does not extend to cover loss or damage that is wilfully or negligently caused.\nClause 32 confers power on the Minister to exempt any person or class of persons from all or any of the provisions of the Bill by way of an order published in the Gazette.\nClause 33 confers on the Magistrate's Court and the District Court jurisdiction to try offences under the Bill.\nClause 34 confers power on the Minister to make regulations that are necessary or expedient to give effect to the Bill.\nThe Minister is expressly conferred with power to make regulations prescribing that buildings, structures or facilities of a specified or described nature, or adapted or designed in a specified or described way, are to be regarded as a single complex of boarding premises, or the criteria by which it is to be determined whether buildings, structures or facilities are to be regarded as a single complex of boarding premises. This is to give certainty in determining whether several buildings on different parcels are to be regarded as a single boarding premises and whether all the beds therein are to be counted to see if the threshold number is attained.\nThe Minister is also conferred power to make regulations to prescribe how to determine the occupancy load of boarding premises and to adopt occupancy loads that may be prescribed by other public authorities.\nClause 35 is a saving and transitional provision that will apply to persons who operate a foreign employee dormitory, or have been granted written permission under the Planning Act (Cap. 232) to develop any land as a foreign employee dormitory, when the Bill comes into force. Such a person can continue to provide that service or develop that land for 6 months and, if, within that period, the person applies for a licence, the person may continue to do so until the date on which the\nCommissioner issues a licence to the person or the date that the application is finally refused or withdrawn.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

In such a case, the company may elect its income that is subject to one of those tax rates as its income that is subject to a higher or lower tax rate (as the case may\nbe) for the purposes of the application of section 37B(4) or (5).\nClause 38 makes an amendment to section 37C (Group relief for Singapore companies) that is consequential on the repeal and re-enactment of section 37B.\nClause 39 amends section 37E (Carry-back of capital allowances and losses) to allow a taxpayer to elect for qualifying deductions for the year of assessment 2020 to be carried back and offset against any of the taxpayer's assessable income for\nthe years of assessment 2019, 2018 and 2017. This is set out in the new section 37E(1A). The deduction must first be made against the assessable income for the year of assessment 2017. Any balance of the deduction must be made against the assessable income for the year of assessment 2018. Any balance thereafter may then be made against the assessable income for the year of assessment 2019.\nIf the taxpayer is entitled to make a deduction under both the new section 37E(1A) and the existing section 37E(1) (which allows a person to carry back qualifying deductions to only the immediate preceding year of assessment) against the person's assessable income for the year of assessment 2017 or 2018, a deduction must first be made under section 37E(1) against the assessable income, before a deduction under the new section 37E(1A) is made against the assessable income.\nA person may elect for a qualifying deduction for the year of assessment 2020 to be deducted under section 37E(1) or the new section 37E(1A).\nClause 39 also amends section 37E to enable the Comptroller to raise an assessment within 7 years after the expiration of the year of assessment 2017 or within 6 years after the expiration of the year of assessment 2018, where the\nComptroller discovers that any qualifying deduction made under the new section 37E(1A) for the year of assessment 2020 against the assessable income of any person for the year of assessment 2017 or the year of assessment 2018 (as the case may be) is excessive.\nFinally, clause 39 makes an amendment to section 37E that is consequential on the repeal and re-enactment of section 37B.\nClause 40 amends section 37K (Deduction for qualifying investments in qualifying start-up companies).

Section 440\nMischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt.\nThis Bill seeks to enable Singapore to give effect to the Convention on the Safety of\nUnited Nations and Associated Personnel (the Convention) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention (the Protocol).\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 defines certain terms used in the Bill.\nClause 3 defines the expression \"UN worker\". The definition covers \"United\nNations personnel\" and \"Associated personnel\" as defined in Article 1 of the\nConvention. Sub-clause (3) implements Article II of the Protocol by expanding the scope of the term \"UN worker\" through an expansion of the scope of the term \"UN operation\". The Minister charged with the responsibility for foreign affairs may certify whether a person is at a specified time a UN worker which will be prima facie evidence of this matter.\nClause 4 extends Singapore jurisdiction to deal with specified crimes against UN workers outside Singapore. The act concerned must be such that, if it had been committed in Singapore, it would constitute an offence specified in the First Schedule.\nIn brief, these crimes concern murder, kidnapping or other attack on the person or liberty of a UN worker.\nClause 5 extends Singapore jurisdiction to deal with specified crimes against the official premises or place of residence of a UN worker, or any vehicle used by such person. The act concerned must be such that, if it had been committed in Singapore, it would constitute an offence specified in the Second Schedule. These offences include causing an explosion and committing mischief.\nClause 6 renders it an offence to threaten, whether in Singapore or outside\nSingapore, to commit certain offences against a UN worker, his official premises or place of residence or a vehicle used by him, in order to compel a person to do or abstain from doing any act.\nClause 7 extends Singapore jurisdiction to deal with an attempt, abetment or conspiracy committed outside Singapore of certain offences against a UN worker, his official premises or place of residence or a vehicle used by him.\nClause 8 provides that, in proceedings for offences under clauses 4 to 7, where the relevant act had been proved to have been committed by the accused, he will be presumed to know that the victim was a UN worker, the premises concerned were the official premises or place of residence of a UN worker or the vehicle concerned was used by such a person.\nClause 9 provides that every person in Singapore who has information which he knows or believes may be of material assistance \u2013\u2013\n(a) in preventing the commission of certain offences in relation to a UN worker, his official premises or place of residence or a vehicle used by him; or\n(b) in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of a person for such offence, must immediately inform a police officer of this.\nClause 10 enables mutual legal assistance to be rendered to a country that is a Party to the Convention for criminal matters involving an offence in that country that corresponds to an offence against a UN worker (as defined in clause 3), and for\nSingapore to request for such assistance from another country for criminal matters involving certain offences in relation to a UN worker, his official premises or place of residence or a vehicle used by him.\nClause 11 deals with extradition to Singapore for offences against a UN worker (as defined in clause 3). It also deals with extradition to a country that is a Party to the\nConvention for an offence that corresponds to an offence against a UN worker, referred to as a relevant offence. The term \"relevant offence\" does not include an offence against a person who is a UN worker by virtue only of the expansion of the term \"UN operation\" under clause 3(3), as this is dealt with by clause 12.\nClause 11 provides that \u2014\n(a) offences against a UN worker will be extraditable crimes;\n(b) offences of a declared Commonwealth country that correspond to relevant offences are extradition crimes in relation to that country;\n(c) where there is no extradition treaty in force between Singapore and a\nConvention country, a notification may be made under section 4 of the\nExtradition Act (Cap. 103) applying that Act as if there were an extradition treaty between them, and in that event that Act will apply to that country as if the only extradition crimes within the meaning of that Act were offences of that country that correspond to relevant offences; and\n(d) where there is an extradition treaty in force between Singapore and a\nConvention country but the treaty does not provide for the extradition of persons accused of or convicted of an offence of that country that corresponds to a relevant offence, a notification may be made under\nsection 4 of the Extradition Act (Cap. 103) applying that Act as if the treaty provided for that matter, and in that event any limitation, condition, exception or qualification specified in any notification or Order in Council that prevents such offence from being considered an extradition crime will be disregarded in the application of that Act to the country.\nClause 12 deals with extradition to a country that is a Party to the Protocol for an offence against a person who is a UN worker by virtue only of the expansion of the term \"UN operation\" under clause 3(3). The clause contains similar terms to clause 11(2) to (9).\nClause 13 provides that no prosecution under the Bill may be instituted except by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.\nClause 14 enables the Minister to amend the Schedules to give effect to the\nConvention or Protocol.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.\nUnited Nations Personnel Bill\nDerivatives\nInternationally\nProtected Persons\nAct (Chapter 145A)\nUK United Nations\nPersonnel Act (1997 c.13)\nSection Heading\nClause\nSection\nShort title\nInterpretation\n2(1)\n\"Convention\"\n\"Convention country\"\n\"country\"\n\"offence against a UN worker\"\n\"Protocol\"\n\"relevant premises\"\n2(3)\n\"UN worker\"\n\"vehicle\"\n2(3)\n2(2)\nUN workers\n3(1)\n4(1)\n3(2)\n4(2)\n3(3)\n3(4)\n4(3)\n3(5)\n3(2)\nOffences committed against UN workers\nOffences committed against premises or vehicles\nMaking threats\n3(2)\nUnited Nations Personnel Bill\nDerivatives\nInternationally\nProtected Persons\nAct (Chapter 145A)\nUK United Nations\nPersonnel Act (1997 c.13)\nSection Heading\nClause\nSection\nAttempt, abetment and conspiracy punishable as offences\nPresumption of knowledge\nInformation relating to offence\nAssistance under Mutual\nAssistance in Criminal\nMatters Act\nExtradition to and from\nConvention countries\nExtradition to Protocol countries\nNo prosecution without\nPublic Prosecutor's consent\nAmendment of\nSchedules",

The amendments relate to \u2014\n(a) registers of controllers of companies, foreign companies and limited liability partnerships;\n(b) registers of members of foreign companies;\n(c) registers of nominee directors of companies; and\n(d) registers of nominee shareholders of companies and foreign companies.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nPART 1\nClause 2 amends the Companies Act.\nClause 2(a) inserts a new subsection (4) in section 380 of the Companies Act to provide that a foreign company must, within 30 days after any change in the particulars required to be kept in its register of members, update its register of members to reflect the change.\nClause 2(b) amends the heading of Part XIA of the Companies Act.\nClause 2(c) and (d) amends section 386AF(7) of the Companies Act to provide that a company or foreign company must ensure that its register of controllers contains the note and prescribed particulars required under the new section 386AFA(3) of the Companies Act (as inserted by clause 2(e) and further explained below) and must update its register of controllers if any change to those particulars occurs.\nClause 2(e) inserts a new section 386AFA in the Companies Act, which applies where a company or foreign company knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that \u2014\n(a) the company or foreign company has no registrable controller (\"controller\" and \"registrable\" are defined in sections 386AB and 386AC of the Companies Act); or\n(b) the company or foreign company has a registrable controller but has not been able to identify the registrable controller.\nIn such circumstances, each director with executive control and each chief executive officer of the company or foreign company is taken to be a registrable controller of the company or foreign company for the purposes of Part XIA of the\nCompanies Act (new section 386AFA(2)). However, such a director or chief executive officer is not a controller for the purposes of section 386AF(9) or (10), 386AG(1) or (2), 386AH(1), 386AI(1), 386AJ(1) or 386AK(1) of the Companies\nAct (new section 386AFA(9)). The new section 386AFA(8) of the Companies Act defines \"director with executive control\" as a director of the company or foreign company who exercises executive control over the daily or regular affairs of the company or foreign company through a senior management position.\nThe company or foreign company must include a note in its register of controllers stating that (as the case may be) it knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that it has no registrable controller, or has a registrable controller but is unable to identify the registrable controller (new section 386AFA(3)(a)(i)). The note must also state that each director with executive control and each chief executive officer of the company or foreign company is taken to be a registrable controller of the company or foreign company (new section 386AFA(3)(a)(ii)).\nThe prescribed particulars of such persons must be included in the register of controllers (new section 386AFA(3)(b)).\nThe note and the prescribed particulars must be included in the register of controllers within the prescribed period mentioned in the new section 386AFA(4) of the Companies Act and updated within the prescribed period mentioned in the new section 386AFA(5) of the Companies Act. The new section 386AFA(6) of the\nCompanies Act requires certain further information to be included in the register of controllers when a registrable controller (within the meaning given by sections 386AB and 386AC of the Companies Act) is subsequently identified.\nUnder the new section 386AFA(7) of the Companies Act, it is an offence to fail to comply with the new section 386AFA(3), (4), (5) or (6) of the Companies Act.\nClause 2(f) inserts a new section 386AKA in the Companies Act. The new section 386AKA(1) and (2) of the Companies Act restates existing requirements under section 386AL(4) and (5) of the Companies Act relating to a register of nominee directors. The new section 386AKA(3), (4) and (5) further provides that the register of nominee directors must be updated where any new fact or particulars are provided to the company, where a director ceases to be a nominee or where there is a change in certain particulars entered in the register. The new section 386AKA(6) of the Companies Act is a restatement of the existing section 386AL(7) of the Companies Act.\nClause 2(g) deletes section 386AL(4), (5) and (7) of the Companies Act, which is re-enacted as the new section 386AKA(1), (2) and (6) of the Companies Act.\nClause 2(h) makes an amendment to section 386AL(8) of the Companies Act that is consequential to the amendment made by clause 2(f).\nClause 2(i) inserts new sections 386ALA and 386ALB in the Companies Act.\nThese sections provide for a new requirement for companies and foreign companies to each keep a register of nominee shareholders and for nominee shareholders to inform their respective companies or foreign companies of the fact that they are, have become or ceased to be nominees, to provide the prescribed particulars of the persons for whom they are nominees, and any changes to those particulars.\nClause 2(j) amends section 386AM(1)(a) of the Companies Act to extend enforcement powers under that provision to the register of nominee shareholders.\nClause 2(k) amends section 386AN of the Companies Act to make clear that the reference to particulars in the register of controllers in subsection (2)(b)(i) includes matters mentioned in the new section 386AFA(3) of the Companies Act.\nClause 2(l) restates section 386AN(3) of the Companies Act to make clear that the obligation to lodge particulars, matters and updates with the Registrar of\nCompanies under section 386AN(2)(b) of the Companies Act (in the prescribed\nform and manner and within the prescribed time) lies with the company or foreign company.\nClause 2(m) makes an amendment to section 386AN(4) of the Companies Act that is consequential to the amendment made by clause 2(l).\nPART 2\nClause 3 amends the Limited Liability Partnerships Act.\nClause 3(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) makes amendments that are analogous to the amendments made to the Companies Act by clause 2(c), (d), (e) and (k), respectively. In particular, clause 3(1)(c) inserts a new section 32FA (renumbered as the new section 47A under clause 3(2)(e)) in the Limited Liability Partnerships\nAct, which applies where a limited liability partnership knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that \u2014\n(a) the limited liability partnership has no registrable controller (\"controller\" and \"registrable\" are defined in sections 32B and 32C (or sections 43 and 44 as renumbered in the 2020 Revised Edition) of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act); or\n(b) the limited liability partnership has a registrable controller but has not been able to identify the registrable controller.\nIn such circumstances, each partner with executive control is taken to be a registrable controller of the limited liability partnership for the purposes of Part 7 of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act. However, such a director or chief executive officer is not a controller for the purposes of section 32F(6) or (7), 32G(1) or (2), 32H(1), 32I(1), 32J(1) or 32K(1) (or section 47(6) or (7), 48(1) or (2), 49(1), 50(1), 51(1) or 52(1) as renumbered in the 2020 Revised Edition) of the\nLimited Liability Partnerships Act (new section 32FA(9) (renumbered as the new section 47A(9) under clause 3(2)(e))). The new section 32FA(8) (renumbered as the new section 47A(8) under clause 3(2)(e)) of the Limited Liability Partnerships\nAct defines \"partner with executive control\" as a partner of the limited liability partnership who exercises executive control over the daily or regular affairs of the limited liability partnership through a senior management position. The limited liability partnership is subject to further similar obligations as a company under the new section 386AFA of the Companies Act (which is explained above).\nClause 3(1)(e) restates section 32M(3) of the Limited Liability Partnerships\nAct to make clear that the obligation to lodge particulars, matters and updates with the Registrar of Limited Liability Partnerships under section 32M(2)(b) of the\nLimited Liability Partnerships Act (in the prescribed form and manner and within the prescribed time) lies with the limited liability partnership.\nClause 3(1)(f) makes an amendment to section 32M(4) of the Limited Liability\nPartnerships Act that is consequential to the amendment made by clause 3(1)(e).\nClause 3(2) updates the cross-references to the sections mentioned in clause 3(1) which are proposed to be renumbered in the next revised edition of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act (the \"2020 Revised Edition\"), and renumbers the new section 32FA (as inserted by clause 3(1)(c)) as the new section 47A (in line with the 2020 Revised Edition).\nPART 3\nClause 4 contains saving and transitional provisions. In particular, clause 4(1) provides that a register of nominee directors kept by a company under and in compliance with section 386AL(4) of the Companies Act, as in force immediately before the date of the deletion of subsection (4) of section 386AL of the\nCompanies Act, is, on or after that date, treated as the register of nominee directors kept by a company under the new section 386AKA(1) of the Companies Act.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

This aligns with the 14-day period during which a purchaser may appeal to the Minister under section 50(4).\nClause 3(a) amends section 59 to remove a requirement in subsection (5) for the\nBoard to state in a notice the date on which the Board intends to lodge an instrument of vesting or a rescission of an agreement for a lease takes effect. This simplifies the notice.\nIn place of the requirement, clause 3(b) inserts a new subsection (5A) that precludes the Board from lodging an instrument of vesting or giving effect to a rescission of an agreement for a lease until 28 days after serving notice of the\nBoard's intent to do so. This aligns with the 28-day period during which a personal representative or an interested person may appeal to the Minister under section 59(6).\nClauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 amend the Act to create a new category of upgrading works called \"commercial property upgrading works\" and provide for such upgrading works to be carried out.\nClause 4 amends section 75 to introduce a new definition of \"commercial property upgrading works\". The term \"commercial property\" is defined in section 2 and generally based on what is permitted under the Planning Act 1998.\nTherefore, the new definition covers not just upgrading works for property used for retail shopping, but also associated commercial and community activities like a child care centre, a commercial school, a community centre, an office or a sports and recreation centre. The clause also makes consequential amendments to existing definitions.\nClause 5 amends section 77 to allow the Board, where a precinct has been declared under section 76, to carry out a poll in connection with a proposal to carry out commercial property upgrading works, of prescribed owners of commercial property. However, the Board may only carry out the proposal with the Minister's approval and if at least 75% of the owners that are polled support the proposal.\nClause 6 amends section 78 to require the Board to carry out commercial property upgrading works that the Minister has approved under section 77. The clause also inserts a new subsection (3A) that allows the Board to recover the costs incurred in respect of those commercial property upgrading works.\nClause 7 amends section 85(b) to specify that the Minister may make rules prescribing the value in votes of owners of flats for commercial property upgrading works, similar to what currently may be prescribed for general upgrading works and specified upgrading works.\nClause 8 repeals and re-enacts section 111 to upgrade the section to the modern text on service of documents under the Act. The section does not deal with service of court documents as this is governed by other written law.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

and\n(b) the lawful directions (general or specific) of the chief executive and an officer or employee of the Agency.\n(7) To avoid doubt, an auxiliary officer does not cease\nto be acting on the direction of an officer or employee of the Agency by reason only that the officer or employee is not present at all times.\"; and\n(i) by inserting, immediately after the word \"employee\" in section 47(1)(a), the words \", an auxiliary officer\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend various Acts that relate to, or are administered by, the\nNational Environment Agency (the Agency).\nIn particular, the Bill amends the National Environment Agency Act (Cap. 195) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to provide for the appointment of individuals as auxiliary officers of the\nAgency;\n(b) to extend the powers of enforcement of an officer or employee of the\nAgency under the Act or any environmental written law to include the photographing or recording of the scene of any offence under the Act or that environmental written law;\n(c) to enable auxiliary officers of the Agency to exercise certain powers of enforcement conferred on an officer or employee of the Agency under the\nAct and certain environmental written laws.\nThe Bill also \u2014\n(a) makes related amendments to the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (Cap. 59), the Environmental Protection and Management Act (Cap. 94A) and the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap. 95), to enable an auxiliary officer of the Agency to be appointed as an \"authorised officer\" for the administration of those Acts; and\n(b) amends the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act and the Environmental\nPublic Health Act to enable an auxiliary police officer appointed under the\nPolice Force Act (Cap. 235) to be appointed as an \"authorised officer\" for the administration of those Acts.\nThe main changes made by the Bill are contained in clause 5.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 5(a) and (b) amends section 2 of the National Environment Agency Act to introduce definitions for \"auxiliary officer\" and \"environmental written law\".\nThe term \"environmental written law\" is used in the amendments to section 42 of the National Environment Agency Act (by clause 5(d), (e) and (g)) and in the new section 42A of that Act (inserted by clause 5(h)). An \"environmental written law\" refers to a written law administered by any of the following:\n(a) the Agency;\n(b) the Director-General of Environmental Protection appointed under section 3(1) of the Environmental Protection and Management Act;\n(c) the Director-General of Public Health appointed under section 3(1) of the\nEnvironmental Public Health Act.\nClause 5(c) inserts a new section 16A in the National Environment Agency Act to empower the Agency to appoint, in writing, any individual, whether or not a public officer, to be an auxiliary officer to assist any officer or employee of the\nAgency in performing any function of the Agency.\nAn auxiliary officer is not an officer or employee of the Agency, and may include a volunteer. An individual who is appointed as an auxiliary officer does not become an agent of the Agency by virtue only of the appointment. An auxiliary officer will not be regarded as being in breach of his or her employment contract by virtue only of being appointed as an auxiliary officer.\nAn individual's appointment as an auxiliary officer can be revoked at any time.\nEvery auxiliary officer will be issued with equipment determined by the chief executive of the Agency (the chief executive) to be necessary for the effectual discharge of the duties of an auxiliary officer.\nClause 5(d), (e), (f) and (g) amends section 42 of the National Environment\nAgency Act to extend the powers of enforcement conferred on an officer or employee of the Agency under the Act or any environmental written law. The new section 42(1)(b) makes it clear that an officer or employee of the Agency may, in relation to any offence under the Act or that environmental written law, photograph or record the scene of the offence and any thing or individual in the scene. The act of photographing the scene of the offence includes the making of a digital image or a moving visual record. The scene of the offence refers to any place or vehicle where the offence was committed, is reasonably suspected to have been committed, or is about to be committed, and extends to any place or vehicle associated with, or relevant to, the commission or suspected commission of the offence.\nClause 5(h) inserts a new section 42A in the National Environment Agency Act to empower the chief executive to authorise, in writing, an auxiliary officer to exercise all or any of the powers conferred on an officer or employee of the Agency under the Act or any environmental written law, in relation to any offence under the\nAct or that environmental written law.\nThe chief executive may limit the powers that an auxiliary officer may exercise, as well as limit when, where in Singapore, and the circumstances in which the auxiliary officer may exercise all or any of those powers.\nAn auxiliary officer may exercise those powers only to the extent authorised by the chief executive and directed by an officer or employee of the Agency. When exercising any power of enforcement, an auxiliary officer must obey all lawful directions of the chief executive and an officer or employee of the Agency. An auxiliary officer is deemed to be a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) when exercising such power, so that the provisions of the Penal Code that apply to public servants also apply to auxiliary officers.\nClause 5(i) amends section 47(1) of the National Environment Agency Act to prohibit an auxiliary officer from disclosing certain information obtained when performing the auxiliary officer's duties or functions, except in certain circumstances.\nClauses 2, 3 and 4 make related amendments to the Control of Vectors and\nPesticides Act, the Environmental Protection and Management Act and the\nEnvironmental Public Health Act, respectively. The amendments enable an auxiliary officer of the Agency to be appointed as an \"authorised officer\" for the administration of those Acts.\nClauses 2(b) and 4(b) also amend the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act and the Environmental Public Health Act, respectively, to enable an auxiliary police officer appointed under the Police Force Act to be appointed as an \"authorised officer\" for the administration of those Acts.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

For this purpose, \"voucher\" is defined as being \u2014\n(a) any physical or electronic thing that upon redemption entitles the holder to receive goods or services up to a value stated on or recorded in or in respect of it in monetary or non-monetary terms; or\n(b) any prepaid phone card or similar item that upon redemption entitles the holder to receive telephone or like services up to the value stated on or recorded in or in respect of it in monetary or non-monetary terms.\nA voucher (other than a prepaid phone card) will not be considered to have stated on or recorded in or in respect of it a value in monetary terms if the reference to the monetary value is in fact a reference to the value ascribed to the goods or services that may be supplied upon redemption of the voucher, for example, where the voucher is for \"a cake worth $10\" or \"any cake not exceeding $10 in value\".\nA voucher (other than a prepaid phone card) will not be considered to have stated on or recorded in or in respect of it a value in non-monetary terms if the non-monetary terms refer to the goods or services that may be supplied upon redemption of the voucher. Examples of non-monetary terms for this purpose would be \"credits\", \"redemption points\" and \"loyalty points\".\nIn certain circumstances, for instance, where the value of a card or prepaid phone card is topped-up by a means other than some other card, there may in fact be no voucher involved. Accordingly, for transactions that do not involve vouchers and that are transactions specified in the new section 35A(5), in order to bring these transactions within the new section 35A(1), they are deemed to involve vouchers as defined in the new section 35A(3).\nClause 5 amends section 37 to provide for the temporary removal of goods, without payment of tax, from a warehouse outside the free trade zone for the purpose of an auction, an exhibition or other similar event involving the display of goods.\nClause 6 amends section 49(2) to require that an application for review and revision state precisely the grounds on which a decision made by the Comptroller under section 49(1) is being objected to.\nClause 7 deletes paragraph 7 of the Third Schedule (including the sub-heading) as it is no longer necessary in consequence of the amendment made by clause 4.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Section 38(2) of the Architects Act is amended by deleting the words \"the register of architects, register of practitioners and register\nof licensees are\" in paragraph (d) and substituting the words \"any register kept and maintained under section 8(1) is\".\nSaving and transitional provisions 27.\u2014(1) To avoid doubt, section 12 applies to and in relation to any architectural services supplied, or offered before, on or after the date\nof commencement of that section.\n(2) Any foreign architect from any country or territory outside\nSingapore who, immediately before the date of commencement of section 14(e), is recognised as a person who may engage in the practice of architecture in Singapore under any scheme administered\nby the Board, is treated as registered under section 15(2A) of the\nArchitects Act.\n(3) Any registered architect who, immediately before the date of commencement of section 15, is recognised as a person who may engage in the practice of architecture in any country or territory\noutside Singapore under any scheme administered by the Board, is treated as recognised under section 15A(2) of the Architects Act.\nThis Bill seeks to amend the Architects Act (Cap. 12) for the following main purposes:\n(a) to give effect to the arrangements made between the Board of\nArchitects (the Board) and the appropriate authorities of any country or territory outside Singapore for the mutual recognition of the qualifications and standards adopted by each of the parties to the arrangement regarding the practice of architecture;\n(b) to make clear that a member elected to the Board and the President of the Board can only serve for 2 consecutive terms;\n(c) to regulate how the Board conducts its meetings and makes decisions outside of a meeting;\n(d) to provide for further functions to be performed by the Board, and the powers of the Board;\n(e) to provide for the various registers to be kept and maintained by the\nBoard;\n(f) to criminalise certain acts relating to the practice of architecture in\nSingapore;\n(g) to prohibit an unauthorised architect from claiming any fee or remuneration in connection with any arbitration, suit or matter for architectural services provided by the unauthorised architect;\n(h) to allow persons who had made payment to an unauthorised architect to recover the money from the unauthorised architect;\n(i) to allow the Registrar of the Board to amend any of the registers kept and maintained by the Board and to remove the names of persons who appear in any such register;\n(j) to provide further grounds for the Board to refuse to issue a practising certificate;\n(k) to provide for further matters which have to be included in the articles of association of a limited corporation or an unlimited corporation when such corporations apply for a licence under the Act;\n(l) to increase the penalties for certain offences under the Act;\n(m) to allow the Board to appoint investigators to investigate into the commission of any offence under the Act and to confer on the investigators such powers as are necessary;\n(n) to extend the deadline for the Board to submit the accounting report to the Minister from 3 months to 6 months.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 2 to insert new definitions of \"architectural firm\", \"architectural practice\", \"foreign architect\", \"participating jurisdiction\", etc.. The clause also makes certain technical amendments to other definitions used in the\nAct.\nClause 3 amends section 4A to make clear that any member elected to the Board can only serve for 2 consecutive terms.\nClause 4 amends section 4C to make clear that the elected President of the Board can only serve for 2 consecutive terms.\nClause 5 amends section 4F by setting out the methods of holding meetings.\nThese can be face\u2010to\u2010face meetings with members physically gathered at a place, or by means of audio, audio and visual, or electronic communication technology such as by telephone or online video conference. However, if technology is used, and a face\u2010to\u2010face meeting is to be dispensed with, all of the members who wish to participate in the meeting must have access to the technology needed to participate in the meeting, and a quorum of members must be able to simultaneously communicate with each other throughout the meeting.\nClause 6 inserts a new section 4G which allows the Board to make a decision by written or electronic means without a meeting. Any document containing the terms of the decision of the Board signed or otherwise approved by the majority of the\nBoard members is taken to be made at a meeting of the Board.\n31\nClause 7 makes technical amendments to section 6 and also confers a new function on the Board to facilitate the mutual recognition, within Singapore and any country or territory outside Singapore, of the qualifications and standards regarding the practice of architecture.\nClause 8 inserts a new section 6A which confers certain powers on the Board to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for, or in connection with, the performance of the functions of the Board.\nClause 9 repeals and re\u2010enacts section 8 to provide for the various registers which are to be kept and maintained by the Board.\nClause 10 makes technical amendments to section 9.\nClause 11 amends section 10 \u2014\n(a) to disallow any person to draw or prepare any architectural document intended to govern the construction, enlargement or alteration of any building unless the person satisfies certain criteria;\n(b) to disallow any person to advertise or hold himself or herself out as a person who is authorised to supply architectural services unless the person is a registered architect who has in force a practising certificate, or is an architectural practice;\n(c) to disallow any person to use the word \"architect\" or any of its derivatives as part of the name of an architectural practice unless the person is authorised to supply architectural services;\n(d) to disallow any person to use verbally or otherwise the word \"Ar.\" as a title before the person's name unless the person is a registered architect who has in force a practising certificate; and\n(e) to provide for the persons who may supply or offer to supply architectural services in Singapore.\nClause 12 repeals and re-enacts section 11 to prohibit any unauthorised person who has supplied or offered to supply any architectural services in Singapore, from claiming or recovering, in connection with any arbitration, suit or matter, any money owed to the unauthorised person in respect of such architectural services.\nThe clause also allows any person who had already paid money to such unauthorised person to recover the money in a court. However, the person cannot recover the money if he or she knows, or has reason to believe, that the person engaged by him or her is a person who had engaged in conduct which is in contravention of section 10.\nClause 13 amends section 12 to prohibit any person from engaging the architectural services of another person in relation to any building works unless the other person satisfies certain criteria.\nClause 14 amends section 15 to provide for the qualifications needed to be registered under the Act. The clause further provides for a registration process to enable any foreign architect from a participating jurisdiction to be registered under the Act. Such a foreign architect who intends to engage in the practice of architecture in Singapore may apply to be registered under the Act. However, the foreign architect must pay the prescribed fee and must have such qualifications, requisite practical experience in architectural work, and have passed such oral or written examinations, as may be approved by the Board.\nAny foreign architect from a participating jurisdiction registered under the new section 15(2B) may be subject to any prohibition, restriction and condition as to the practice of architecture imposed by the Board. For example, it is possible for the\nBoard to restrict a foreign architect to only engage in the practice of architecture in\nSingapore in collaboration with an architectural practice in connection with any particular building works. This would mean that such a foreign architect so registered cannot supply, or offer to supply, architectural services independently, or as an employee of an architectural practice, but must do so in collaboration with an architectural practice.\nClause 15 inserts a new section 15A. The new section 15A provides for the recognition of registered architects who intend to supply, or offer to supply, architectural services in any participating jurisdiction. The recognition in\nSingapore before a registered architect can engage in the practice of architecture in a participating jurisdiction is necessary due to the requirement for recognition as set out in the terms of the arrangement between the Board and the foreign registration authority. The Board must also be satisfied that the registered architect has satisfied such requirements set by the Board.\nClause 16 repeals and re\u2010enacts section 17A to empower the Registrar of the\nBoard to amend or correct any register, and to remove the name of any person from any register in certain circumstances.\nClause 17 amends section 17B to empower the Board to remove from the register of architects the names and particulars of any registered architect if the registered architect refuses or fails to comply with certain orders made by the\nBoard or the Disciplinary Committee. Before removing the name of a registered architect, the Board must notify the architect concerned of its intention to do so.\nClause 18 amends section 18 to specify the additional information which has to be stated in the declaration when a registered architect applies for a practising certificate. The clause also provides for the additional grounds under which the\nBoard may refuse to issue a practising certificate.\nClause 19 amends section 20 to specify the contents which have to be provided in the articles of association of a limited corporation or an unlimited corporation in a case where the Board grants the limited corporation or unlimited corporation a licence to supply architectural services in Singapore.\nClause 20 amends section 26A to empower the Board to revoke a licence granted to a corporation, partnership or limited liability partnership if the corporation, partnership or limited liability partnership has contravened any condition imposed under section 21. The clause also empowers the Board to impose a financial penalty on, or issue a censure to, any corporation, partnership or limited liability partnership if the Board thinks that there is no cause of sufficient gravity for revoking a licence.\nClause 21 makes some technical amendments to section 28.\nClause 22 makes a technical amendment to section 31G(1)(e) and also amends section 31G(2) to increase the penalty which a Disciplinary Committee may impose on a registered architect after due inquiry into a complaint or matter relating to the registered architect.\nClause 23 inserts a new section 31K, which empowers the Board to appoint a member or an employee of the Board, a public officer or any other person as an investigator to investigate into the commission of an offence under the Act. The powers conferred on the investigator include the power of search and requiring persons to furnish information or to attend before the investigator for questioning, etc.. It is an offence for a person to obstruct an investigator or to fail to comply with any requisition or order of an investigator.\nClause 24 amends section 32(6) by extending the time by which the Board has to submit to the Minister, a report of its functions, proceedings and activities during the preceding year.\nClause 25 repeals and re\u2010enacts section 35 and inserts a new section 35A.\nThe new section 35 deals with corporate offenders and for attributing criminal liability to officers of corporate entities for offences committed by their entities.\nCorporations like companies can be held directly liable for their conduct and can be found guilty of, and punished for, the commission of an offence. As a separate legal entity, liability for the offence is imposed on the corporation itself and is not generally attributed to its officers and employees unless there is a provision like the new section 35.\nThe new section 35A deals with unincorporated entities like partnerships and associations and for attributing criminal liability to officers of unincorporated entities for offences committed by their bodies. The clause also provides clarity where the offence by the unincorporated entity requires a mental element and is not a strict liability offence.\nClause 26 makes a technical amendment to section 38(2).\nClause 27 sets out the saving and transitional provisions.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

Each proposer, seconder and assentor must be a person whose name appears in the register of electors for the constituency in which the person seeks election. The form of the nomination paper will no longer require their register numbers to be stated, as the proposer, seconder and assentors will each be described in a manner similar as that of the nominee.\nClause 6 amends section 27B similarly with regard to nomination papers for a group representation constituency.\nClause 7 amends section 29 to require nomination papers to be delivered to the\nReturning Officer, in duplicate and in person, by the nominee accompanied by his proposer, seconder and at least 4 assentors. Nomination papers must be so delivered between 11 a.m. and 12 noon (both times inclusive) on nomination day. If not so delivered, the nomination will be rejected. The section is also amended to allow the candidate for election in a constituency, his proposer, seconder and assentors and one other person (if any) he appoints in writing to be present during the proceedings to examine the nomination papers for any other candidate for that same constituency.\nClause 8 introduces a new section 29A which will allow a candidate or nominee, upon any error or omission in his nomination paper being brought to his attention (whether by the Returning Officer or following an objection made under section 30), to amend his nomination paper. However, the candidate or nominee can only do so before\n12 noon on nomination day. Also, this facility does not allow the candidate or nominee to substitute another person as candidate or nominee or as proposer, seconder or assentor.\nClause 9 amends section 30 to make it clear that an objection to the nomination paper of a candidate or a group of candidates for a constituency may be made only by another candidate for election for that same constituency, or by that other candidate's proposer, seconder or any of his assentors, or the one other person (if any) he has appointed to be present at the proceedings. This amendment does not preclude the\nReturning Officer himself lodging an objection.\nClause 10 repeals and re-enacts section 31 regarding the persons entitled to be present at nomination proceedings. Apart from the Returning Officer and the persons he authorises to assist him at such proceedings, the only other persons entitled to be present at nomination proceedings are the candidates, each candidate's proposer,\nseconder and assentors, one other person (if any) appointed by the candidate to be present at the proceedings, and any other person with the written permission of the\nReturning Officer to be present at those proceedings.\nClause 11 amends section 32(1) to make it clear that withdrawal of candidature must be done in person.\nClause 12 amends section 32A (on multiple candidature) to provide that if, at the close of nominations, a person is nominated to be a candidate in more than one constituency at a general election, or a person is nominated more than once to be a candidate for election in the same constituency, all the nominations will be void. To avoid nullifying his candidature, the person has to withdraw all but one of his nominations before 12 noon on nomination day.\nClause 13 amends section 33 to allow the Returning Officer to declare the election results for a constituency before 12.30 p.m. if, at 12 noon on nomination day for an election in any electoral division, only one candidate or one group of candidates is nominated for that constituency.\nClause 14 amends section 74 to abolish the requirement that the returns respecting election expenses must be accompanied by a statutory declaration as to the truth of the contents. Instead, the return respecting election expenses will need to be accompanied only by an ordinary declaration made by the candidate concerned and his election agent.\nSection 74 is also amended to dispense with the requirement to disclose promises made to candidates or their election agents as regards election expenses. Candidates and their election agents will in future need to disclose all donations as defined by the\nPolitical Donations Act (Cap. 236) that have been accepted by the candidate or his election agent.\nWith these amendments to section 74, the form of the returns can then be re- designed to reduce repetitive supply of similar post-election information by candidates and election agents when complying with the Act and the Political Donations Act.\nClause 15 amends section 103 concerning errors in documents prepared or issued in connection with parliamentary elections, so as to include omissions. The amendments also provide that a nomination paper may not be rejected, and no objection may be allowed, because of any error (including errors in numbers) or omission in the nomination paper in relation to the description or any particulars of the candidate or nominee, or his proposer or seconder or any of his assentors, if the particulars contained in the nomination paper are sufficient to identify the candidate or nominee, or his proposer, seconder or assentor, as the case may be, or to identify any place specified in the nomination paper.\nClause 16 inserts a new section 109 to allow for the composition of offences under the Act or any regulations made thereunder. The offences will be those the Minister prescribes by regulations to be compoundable. The Returning Officer or an authorised officer of the Elections Department may compound any such offence by collecting from a person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence one half of the amount\nof the maximum fine that is prescribed for the offence, or a sum not exceeding $500, whichever is the lower.\nClause 17 amends the First Schedule by deleting Form 10 (statutory declaration as to candidate's qualifications) and Form 21 (statement on oath by election agent regarding return respecting election expenses). The amendment is consequential to the amendments in clauses 5, 6 and 14.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

        "text": "Notification\nNo.\n32 \u2014 The\nHigh\nCourt (Admiralty\nJurisdiction) (Amendment) Bill is hereby published for general information. It was introduced in Parliament on the 10th day of November 2003.\nPublished by Authority\nY, NOVEMBER 11\nNO. 32]\n[2003\nHigh Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) (Amendment) Bill\nBill No. 32/2003.\nRead the first time on 10th November 2003.\nA BILL i n t i t u l e d\nAn Act to amend the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Chapter 123 of the 2001 Revised Edition).\nBe it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the\nParliament of Singapore, as follows:\nShort title and commencement\n1. This Act may be cited as the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) (Amendment) Act 2003 and shall come into operation on such date as the\nMinister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint.\nAmendment of section 4\n2. Section 4 of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act is amended by deleting subsection (4) and substituting the following subsection:\n\"(4) In the case of any such claim as is mentioned in section 3(1)(d) to (q), where \uf8e7\n(a) the claim arises in connection with a ship; and\n(b) the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam (referred to in this subsection as the relevant person) was, when the cause of action arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control of, the ship, an action in rem may (whether or not the claim gives rise to a\nmaritime lien on that ship) be brought in the High Court against \uf8e7\n(i) that ship, if at the time when the action is brought the relevant person is either the beneficial owner of that ship as respects all the shares in it or the charterer of that ship under a charter by demise; or\n(ii) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is brought, the relevant person is the beneficial owner as respects all the shares in it.\".\nThis Bill seeks to amend the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap.123).\nThe Bill implements the recommendations of the Attorney-General's Chambers' Law\nReform and Revision Division in their Consultation Paper, Admiralty Jurisdiction of the High Court: Arrest of Ships on Demise Charter to Secure the Obligations of the\nDemise Charterer (LRRD 1/2003).\nThe provisions of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act as they presently stand do not permit a claimant to arrest a vessel under demise charter (bareboat charter) even where the demise charterer is himself the person liable to the claimant. If a debt is\nowed by the beneficial owner of the ship, a claimant may arrest that ship to secure payment of the debt, subject to certain conditions. However, if the debt is owed by a demise charterer, the claimant may not arrest that same ship even though the demise charterer has the same control of the ship as an owner.\nMaritime claims may be pursued by an action in personam or an action in rem. An action in personam is an action against the defendant personally. An action in rem, unique to admiralty law, is an action that is pursued against the \"thing\" (the res) rather than a person. The \"thing\" is usually the ship and the action is commenced by the arrest of the ship.\nClause 1 relates to the short title and commencement.\nClause 2 amends section 4(4) and is modelled after the UK Supreme Court Act 1981. At present, under section 4(4), the High Court may arrest a ship in connection with which a claim arises, only where the person who would be liable in personam is the full beneficial owner of the ship. The amendment extends the present right of action in rem by allowing the High Court to arrest a ship where either the owner or the charterer by demise (the bareboat charterer) is the person who would be liable in personam. A claimant who succeeds in establishing a claim in relation to the ship is entitled to satisfaction from the proceeds of the sale of the ship, notwithstanding that the owner of the ship is not liable in personam on the claim. Such an owner is, however, not personally liable for any shortfall between the judgment sum and proceeds from the sale of the ship; his liability extends only to the loss of the ship (or the value of the security put up to obtain its release). The amendment therefore creates not only procedural rights but also certain substantive rights in favour of a claimant.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

With the amendments, the orders will have effect on or after 1 April 2020 on income received in Singapore that is paid out of income or gains \u2014\n(a) relating to immovable property situated outside Singapore and acquired by the trustee or subsidiary before that date; and\n(b) derived either at a time when the trustee or subsidiary beneficially owns the property (e.g. rental income), or from the disposal of the property (e.g. capital gains).\nClause 6 amends section 13A (Exemption of shipping profits) to provide that the income of a shipping enterprise from a Singapore ship used for offshore renewable energy activity or offshore mineral activity, as well as various other activities concerning a ship used for such activity, is exempt from tax.\nThe clause also provides that the income of a shipping enterprise from foreign exchange and risk management activities carried out in connection with various tax\u2010exempt activities is exempt from tax.\nClause 7 amends section 13F (Exemption of international shipping profits) to provide that the income of an approved international shipping enterprise from the following activities is exempt from tax:\n(a) various activities (such as operation outside the limits of the Singapore port, and charter, mobilisation and demobilisation of a ship used outside those limits) concerning a foreign ship that is used for offshore renewable energy activity or offshore mineral activity;\n(b) the sale of a foreign ship used for offshore renewable energy activity or offshore mineral activity;\n(c) the assignment of a buyer's rights under a construction contract for a ship for such activity, and is intended to be a foreign ship for use for such activity or a prescribed purpose as defined in section 13F(6);\n(d) the sale of shares in a special purpose company that owns a ship mentioned in paragraph (a) above or is the buyer under a construction contract for a ship mentioned in paragraph (c) above;\n(e) the sale mentioned in the existing subsection (1)(g) or in paragraph (d) above, of shares in a special purpose company whose only business or intended business is undertaking an activity mentioned in paragraph (a) above;\n(f) foreign exchange and risk management activities carried out in connection with various tax\u2010exempt activities.\nClause 8 amends section 13H (Exemption of income of venture company) to remove the power to make regulations to subject the income of an approved venture company from making approved investments to tax at a concessionary rate. Regulations may only be made to exempt such income from tax.\nClause 9 amends section 13S (Exemption of income of shipping investment enterprise) \u2014\n(a) to provide for a tax exemption on income derived by an approved shipping investment enterprise from chartering or finance leasing its sea\u2010going ship, irrespective of who the counterparty is; and\n(b) to enable the Minister or an appointed person to specify a period (which must not exceed 40 years) during which income from a ship used for offshore renewable energy or offshore mineral activity is exempt from\ntax.\nClause 10 amends section 13U (Exemption of income of not-for-profit organisation) to extend until 31 March 2022 the period during which a not\u2010for\u2010profit organisation may be approved for the purposes of a tax exemption under that section.\nClause 11 amends section 13Z (Exemption of gains or profits from disposal of ordinary shares) to extend the period for the disposal of ordinary shares the gains or profits from which are exempt from tax, to 31 May 2022.\nClause 12 amends section 14 (Deductions allowed) to include, in the definitions of \"general contribution\" and \"medical expenses\", a contribution by an employer to an employee's medisave account under subsection (1)(fb). These terms are used in section 14(5), (6) and (6B). These provisions help to determine how much of an employer's medical expenses may be allowed as a deduction.\nClause 13 amends subsection (2A) of section 14B (Further deduction for expenses relating to approved fairs, exhibitions or trade missions or to maintenance of overseas trade office). That subsection currently provides that where a claim by a company or firm for a deduction under that section is for qualifying expenses incurred between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2016 for the primary purpose of\npromoting the trading of goods or the provision of services, and the total of such expenses and the expenses for which a deduction is claimed under section 14K(1A) does not exceed $100,000 per year of assessment, there is no need for the company or firm to be first approved by the Minister or a person appointed by the Minister.\nThe amendment changes the end date by which the expenses must be incurred to\nClause 13 also amends section 14B(12) to extend the last day by which a company or firm may be approved for a deduction under that section to 31 March\nClause 14 amends section 14K (Further or double deduction for overseas investment development expenditure) for similar purposes to the amendments made to section 14B.\nClause 15 inserts a new section 14Z to provide for how an expense incurred on or after 25 March 2016 and before \u2014\n(a) the date a person derives the first dollar of income from a trade, business, profession or vocation; or\n(b) the commencement date of a trade, business or profession, and is deductible under a provision of Part Vof the Act, is to be deducted in 2 cases.\nIf the taxpayer earns normal income, concessionary income and exempt income (or any 2 of these) in the basis period in which the date mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) above falls, and the Comptroller is satisfied that \u2014\n(a) the expense is incurred in the production of one of those incomes only; or\n(b) the expense would, had it been incurred after the commencement of the trade, business, profession or vocation, have been incurred in the production of one of those incomes only, the expense is to be deducted against that income alone. Paragraph (b) above is needed because pre\u2010commencement expenses cannot be considered as being incurred in the production of income.\nIn any other case, it is to be pro-rated according to the amount each type of income bears to the total income.\nIf the taxpayer earns only concessionary income or exempt income in that basis period, the new section 14Z provides that the expense is to be deducted against that income.\nClause 16 inserts a new section 14ZA to allow a deduction for certain expenditure incurred for an issue of certain retail bonds. The retail bonds are straight debentures and post\u2010seasoning debentures the offer of which is exempt from prospectus requirements under various regulations made under the Securities\nand Futures Act (Cap. 289), as well as potential seasoned debentures, i.e.\ndebentures intended to be made available for trading by retail investors on a securities exchange. The section also allows a deduction for certain expenditure incurred for making available potential seasoned debentures for such trading.\nClause 17 inserts a new section 14ZB to allow a deduction to a company, firm or body of persons for certain expenditure it incurs during the period its employees provided services to an institution of a public character by arrangement with the institution and on the instruction or request of the company, firm or body, or during the period of secondment of its employees to such an institution. The deduction is as follows:\n(a) a deduction of 150% of the expenditure, if the expenditure is deductible under section 14(1);\n(b) a deduction of 250% of the expenditure, if the expenditure is not so deductible.\nThe expenditure eligible for the deduction is the salary expenditure during the period the services are provided (or the time off in lieu given) or the period of the secondment, as well as the expenses necessary for providing those services or services during the secondment.\nA qualifying person is allowed to claim the deduction for expenditure of up to $250,000 for each year of assessment. The total expenditure in respect of which deductions may be allowed to all claimants in respect of each institution of a public character is $50,000 for each calendar year.\nClause 18 amends section 15 (Deductions not allowed) \u2014\n(a) to disapply subsection (1)(b) (no deduction for expenses which are not wholly and exclusively made for acquiring the income) to any expenditure qualifying for deduction under the new section 14ZB; and\n(b) to disapply subsection (1)(b) and (c) (no deduction for capital withdrawn or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital) to any expenditure qualifying for deduction under the new section 14ZA.\nClause 19 amends section 18C (Initial and annual allowances for certain buildings and structures) to enable the Minister or a person appointed by the\nMinister to approve a construction or renovation for the purposes of the allowance where the completed building or structure is to be used by multiple persons or for multiple trades or businesses, or both. This amendment applies only to a case where both the application for the allowance and the application for the planning or conservation permission are made on or after that date.\nThe approving authority must be satisfied that at least 80% of its total floor area is to be used by a person who is either the applicant for the original approval or\nrelated to that applicant, or by more than one person who satisfy the following requirements of relatedness:\n(a) each of them is related to at least one of the others;\n(b) either one of them is the applicant and the others are all related to the applicant, or all of them are related to the applicant.\nThe approving authority must also be satisfied that at least 80% of its total floor area is to be used for one or more trades or businesses that are prescribed by regulations. The approving authority must further be satisfied that the construction or renovation promotes the prescribed intensified use of the land for that trade or business or (if there are multiple trades or businesses) the one designated in the regulations.\nWhere the construction or renovation has been approved for the allowance, an annual allowance under subsection (4) will only be given if at least 80% of the total floor area of the subject matter of every issued temporary occupation permit or (if all temporary occupation permits have been issued) the entire subject matter of the approved construction or renovation, is used at the end of the basis period for the trade or business or any trade or business specified in the original application.\nFurther, the user must be \u2014\n(a) the applicant for the original approval or related to the applicant; or\n(b) if there is more than one user, persons who satisfy the requirements of relatedness described above.\nClause 20 amends section 19B (Writing-down allowances for intellectual property rights) \u2014\n(a) to allow a company to elect a writing-down period of 5 years, 10 years or 15 years for capital expenditure incurred in acquiring intellectual property rights, from the year of assessment 2017 onwards;\n(b) to substitute, for the purpose of computing the amount of the writing\u2010down allowance to be given, the amount of capital expenditure in acquiring intellectual property rights with the open\u2010market price for those rights, if the expenditure exceeds the price. This applies to intellectual property rights acquired on or after\n(c) to substitute, for the purpose of determining the amount of the charge to be made for disposing any intellectual property rights for which a writing\u2010down allowance has been made, the price for such disposal with their open\u2010market price, if the disposal price is less than the open\u2010market price. This applies to intellectual property rights disposed of on or after 25 March 2016; and\n(d) to clarify that the enhanced writing-down allowances under subsection (1BAA) are to be given according to the applicable writing\u2010down period of 5 years, 10 years or 15 years from the year of assessment 2017 onwards.\nThe amendments to section 19B for the purposes in paragraphs (b) and (c) above are illustrated in the following examples:\nExample 1\nA company pays $1.2 million in full for intellectual property rights under an agreement signed on 25 March 2016. The price the rights could have been purchased in the open\u2010market on that date is $1 million. The Comptroller may treat the capital expenditure for computing the allowance under subsection (1AA) or (1BAA) as $1 million instead of $1.2 million.\nWhere the Comptroller has so treated the amount of $1 million as the amount of that expenditure, that amount will also be treated as that expenditure for the purpose of computing the charge to be made on the company in the event of a disposal of those rights after the writing\u2010down period under subsection (5).\nExample 2\nA company acquires intellectual property rights by making 2 instalment payments of $0.6 million each in 2 separate basis periods. The agreement for acquisition is signed on 25 March 2016. The price the rights could have been purchased in the open\u2010market on that date is $1 million. The Comptroller may treat the amount of $0.5 million as the expenditure incurred in each basis period for computing the writing\u2010down allowance to be given to the company under subsection (1AA). The amount of $0.5 million is arrived at as follows:\n$0:6 million $1:2 million \ufffd$1 million\nWhere the Comptroller has so treated the amount of $0.5 million as the amount of the expenditure for a basis period, that amount will also be treated as the expenditure for that basis period for the purpose of computing the charge to be made on the company in the event of a disposal of those rights after the writing\u2010down period under subsection (5). In other words, if the Comptroller treats the amount of $0.5 million as the amount of expenditure for each of the 2 basis periods, the capital expenditure incurred in acquiring the rights for the purpose of computing the charge under subsection (5) will be $1 million (2 \u00d7 $0.5 million).\nThe Comptroller may also replace the cash price of the intellectual property rights with the open-market price of $1 million for the purpose of computing the enhanced allowance under subsection (1BAA).\nA company acquires intellectual property rights by making 2 instalment payments of $0.6 million each in 2 separate basis periods. The agreement for acquisition is signed on 25 March 2016. Before the end of the writing\u2010down period, the rights are sold for $0.8 million. The price the rights could have fetched at the time of the sale is $1.1 million. The total amount of allowances already made to the company is $0.84 million. If the Comptroller treats the open\u2010market price of $1.1 million as the price at which the prices are sold, then the amount of charge that is to be made on the company under subsection (4) is $0.74 million, being the lower of \u2014\n(a) the difference between $1.1 million and $0.36 million (being the amount of allowance yet to be allowed); and\n(b) $0.84 million (being the total amount of allowances already made).\nClause 21 amends section 37E (Carry\u2010back of capital allowances and losses) to amend the definition of \"concessionary rate of tax\", first by adding the word \"(repealed)\" against provisions which have been repealed by clause 59, and secondly, by specifying that the term includes a rate specified under section 19J(5C) or (5E) or 19KA(1)(b) of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (Cap. 86) (which pertains to concessionary tax rates applicable to development and expansion companies under that Act).\nClause 22 makes various consequential amendments to section 37I (Cash payout under Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme) arising from the amendments made to section 19B.\nClause 23 amends section 37L (Deduction for acquisition of shares of companies) to increase the maximum capital expenditure on share acquisition allowed a deduction under this section, from $20 million to $40 million. The amendments are explained below:\n(a) subsection (11A) (which limits the total expenditure for all acquisitions of an acquiring company falling within one basis period to $20 million) is amended to restrict it to the following acquisitions (called in this paragraph pre\u20101 April 2016 acquisitions):\n(i) acquisitions which are made before 1 April 2016, except for those related to certain \"anchor acquisitions\" (i.e. those that result in the crossing of specified shareholding thresholds) made on or after that date;\n(ii) acquisitions made on or after that date which are related to certain \"anchor acquisitions\" made before that date;\n(b) the new subsection (11AB) provides that the total expenditure for all acquisitions of an acquiring company falling within one basis period that is eligible for the deduction is $40 million. The subsection applies\nto the following acquisitions (called in this paragraph post\u20101 April 2016 acquisitions):\n(i) acquisitions which are made on or after 1 April 2016, except for those related to certain \"anchor acquisitions\" made before that date; and\n(ii) acquisitions made before that date which are related to certain \"anchor acquisitions\" made on or after that date;\n(c) subsection (11B) (which provides that where a company has in a basis period an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4) and an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4A), the maximum deduction allowable for all acquisitions in that period is $5 million) is amended to restrict it to a case where the acquisitions \u2014\n(i) include an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4), and an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4A) that is made before\n(ii) do not include another \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4A) made on or after 1 April 2016;\n(d) the new subsection (11C) provides that where an acquiring company has in a basis period an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4) or (4A) made before\nand an \"anchor acquisition\" in subsection (4A) made on or after 1 April 2016, the maximum deductions allowable for its acquisitions in that period are:\n(i) if a deduction is claimed for those acquisitions which are pre\u20101 April 2016 acquisitions and acquisitions in subsection (4), $5 million;\n(ii) if a deduction is claimed for those acquisitions which are post\u20101 April 2016 acquisitions, $10 million;\n(iii) if a deduction is claimed for both types of acquisitions, $10 million.\nClause 24 amends section 39 (Relief and deduction for resident individual) to amend the amount of tax relief for a cash top\u2010up of a Central Provident Fund (CPF) retirement or special account, which is currently the lower of the top\u2010up amount subject to a limit that is the maximum amount by which the account may be topped\u2010up in accordance with CPF legislation, and $7,000. The limit on the top\u2010up amount for computing the tax relief is replaced with a prescribed maximum relief amount. The amendment is made because starting on 1 January 2016, certain individuals may receive top\u2010ups to their CPF retirement accounts of up to 3 times the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS). The limit on the top\u2010up amount for computing the tax relief will, however, still be computed by reference to the current Full\nRetirement Sum (FRS) (which is twice the BRS). Because that limit is now prescribed in rules, it can be adjusted by rules to keep up with any change to the\nCPF scheme for the topping\u2010up of CPF accounts.\nClause 25 inserts a new section 39A to provide for a cap of $80,000 on the total amount of deductions allowable under section 39 to an individual for each year of assessment, beginning with the year of assessment 2018.\nClauses 26, 27 and 28 amend section 40B (Relief for non\u2010resident employees), section 40C (Relief for non\u2010resident SRS members) and section 40D (Relief for non\u2010resident deriving income from activity as public entertainer and employee, etc.), respectively, to clarify that the cap on the total section 39 deductions allowable to an individual under the new section 39A applies in computing the tax payable by a Singapore resident who is in the same circumstances as those of the non\u2010resident person to whom section 40B, 40C or 40D applies. Sections 40B, 40C and 40D require such amount of tax to be computed so that the total relief given to the non\u2010resident person under those sections will not result in that person paying less tax than a Singapore resident in like circumstances.\nClause 29 amends section 43 (Rate of tax upon companies and others) to provide for tax transparency for rental support payment for any real property that is made to a real estate investment trust, and to apply subsection (3B) (distribution of certain income by trustee of a real estate investment trust to a qualifying non\u2010resident subject to tax at 10%) to a distribution made out of such payment.\nClause 30 amends section 43A (Concessionary rate of tax for Asian Currency\nUnit, Fund Manager and securities company) to provide that the only concessionary rate of tax that may be levied by regulations on qualifying income of a financial institution with an Asian Currency Unit, a Fund Manager or a company dealing in securities, is 10%.\nClause 31 repeals and re\u2010enacts section 43C (Exemption and concessionary rate of tax for insurance and reinsurance business). The re\u2010enacted section 43C \u2014\n(a) specifies that the concessionary tax rate that may be levied by the regulations on qualifying income of an approved insurer from offshore life business and the business of insuring and reinsuring offshore risks, is 10%;\n(b) enables regulations to be made to levy a concessionary tax rate of 5%, 8% or 10% (depending on the date of approval of the insurer) on the qualifying income of an approved specialised insurer from carrying on insurance and reinsurance business;\n(c) enables regulations to be made to levy a concessionary tax rate of 10% on the qualifying income of certain approved insurers from carrying on marine hull and liability insurance business or offshore captive insurance business; and\n(d) enables regulations to be made to provide for the deduction of any expenses, allowances, losses and donations against the incentivised income otherwise than in accordance with the Act.\nClause 32 amends section 43E (Concessionary rate of tax for headquarters company) to provide that the only concessionary rate of tax that may be levied by regulations on qualifying income of headquarters companies, is 10%.\nClause 33 amends section 43G (Concessionary rate of tax for Finance and\nTreasury Centre) \u2014\n(a) to extend the period during which the approval of a Finance and\nTreasury Centre may be granted by another 5 years, i.e. till 31 March 2021; and\n(b) to provide for a concessionary rate of tax of 8% on income derived by a company from qualifying activities and qualifying services carried out by its Finance and Treasury Centre that is approved as such on or after\nClause 34 amends section 43I (Concessionary rate of tax for offshore leasing of machinery and plant) to provide that the only concessionary rate of tax applicable to the income of leasing companies from offshore leasing of any machinery or plant or other prescribed activities, is 10%.\nClause 35 amends section 43J (Concessionary rate of tax for trustee company) to provide that the only concessionary rate of tax that may be levied by regulations on qualifying income of approved trustee companies, is 10%.\nClause 36 amends section 43N (Concessionary rate of tax for income derived from debt securities) to provide that the only concessionary rate of tax that may be levied by regulations on qualifying income from debt securities, is 10%.\nClause 37 amends section 43P (Concessionary rate of tax for global trading company and qualifying company) to enable qualifying companies that carry on prescribed treasury activities or advisory services in relation to mergers and acquisitions, to enjoy the tax concession on their income from such activities.\nClause 38 amends section 43ZF (Concessionary rate of tax for shipping\u2010related support services) to extend the definition of \"shipping\u2010related business\" to include the use of any ship for offshore renewable energy activity or offshore mineral activity. Under that section, \"corporate service\" (one of the incentivised activities) is defined as one of several types of services performed for an approved related company of an approved company. \"Related company\" is in turn defined as a company that carries on a shipping\u2010related business.\nClause 39 makes consequential amendments to section 43ZG (Concessionary rate of tax for income derived from managing approved venture company) arising from the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment)\nAct 2016 (Act 11 of 2016) (Amendment Act). The tax relief period for the relevant activity of a fund management company is either its tax relief period under the repealed section 18 of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income\nTax) Act (Cap. 86) (EEIA) or, if its tax relief period for that activity has yet to expire by 19 April 2016 (the date of commencement of the amendments made by the Amendment Act to Part III of the EEIA), the period treated as its tax relief period under section 37 of the Amendment Act.\nClause 40 amends section 45 (Withholding of tax in respect of interest paid to non-resident persons) to enable the Minister to make rules to prescribe a different withholding tax rate from that set out in the section for any person or class of persons. The section is also amended to enable the Comptroller to allow any person or class of persons (besides banks and financial institutions) to give the\nComptroller a notice of a deduction of tax within a different period from that specified in the section, as well as to pay the Comptroller the deducted tax within a different period from that specified in the section.\nClause 41 amends section 45EA (Approval of deduction of investment from\nSRS account of non\u2010citizen) to enable the Minister to make rules to prescribe a different withholding tax rate from that set out in the section to be applied before an\nSRS operator approves a deduction of investment from an SRS account for any\nSRS member or class of SRS members.\nClause 42 amends section 45G (Application of section 45 to distribution from any real estate investment trust) to provide that a trustee of a real estate investment trust need not withhold tax on a distribution to an international organisation that is exempt from tax on such distribution because of an order made under the\nInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act (Cap. 145).\nClause 43 amends section 63 (Furnishing of estimate of chargeable income if no return is made under section 62) to require a non\u2010individual which has to furnish an estimate of its chargeable income for any year of assessment, to do so using the electronic service provided under section 8A if rules are made applying that requirement to the non\u2010individual. The section is further amended to enable the\nMinister to make rules to exempt a person or class of persons from the requirement under section 63 to furnish an estimate of chargeable income.\nClause 44 repeals and re-enacts section 65 (Power to call for returns, books, etc.) to remove the power of the Comptroller to require a person to attend before the\nComptroller to produce a document for the Comptroller's examination. This power now appears in the amended section 65B.\nClause 45 amends section 65B (Power of Comptroller to obtain information) for the following purposes:\n(a) to enable the Comptroller or an authorised officer, when exercising any of his or her powers on any premises, to require a person to answer questions or to produce documents for inspection;\n(b) to enable the Comptroller to give notice to a person to attend before the\nComptroller or an authorised officer to answer questions or produce documents for inspection. The power to require a person to attend before the Comptroller and produce documents to the Comptroller for inspection is currently found in section 65.\nClause 46 amends section 65C (Failure to comply with section 64, 65, 65A or\n65B) \u2014\n(a) to create an offence of failing to answer a question by the Comptroller or an authorised officer when attending before him or her pursuant to a notice under the amended section 65B;\n(b) to enhance the punishment for the offence of not complying with a notice or requirement under section 64, 65, 65A or 65B, or hindering or obstructing the Comptroller or an authorised officer in performing his or her duties under section 65B;\n(c) to clarify that the reference to a notice or requirement in that offence includes a notice or requirement by an officer authorised by the\nComptroller; and\n(d) to make other amendments consequential on the amendments made to section 65B.\nClause 47 makes amendments to section 65D (Section 65B notice applies notwithstanding duty of secrecy under Banking Act or Trust Companies Act) that are consequential on the amendments made to section 65B.\nClause 48 amends section 68 (Official information and secrecy, and returns by employer) to enable the Comptroller (in any particular case or class of cases) to waive the following requirements for a notice, or allow the notice to be given after the event has taken place:\n(a) the requirement that an employer give a notice to the Comptroller that he or she ceases or is ceasing to employ a non\u2010Singaporean employee, or that a non\u2010Singaporean employee is leaving or is about to leave\nSingapore;\n(b) the requirement that partners give a notice to the Comptroller that another partner is ceasing to be one or is leaving Singapore.\nClause 49 amends section 71 (Return to be made by partnership) to enable the\nMinister to exempt a person or class of persons from the requirement under subsection (3) to furnish an estimate of income of a partnership.\nClause 50 amends section 76 (Service of notices of assessment and revision of assessment) \u2014\n(a) to extend the period by which a notice of objection to an assessment or a notice of incorrect assessment must be made by a company, to\n2 months from the date of service of the notice of assessment; and\n(b) to enable the Minister to make rules to substitute the statutory period for giving such a notice for all persons or cases, a class of persons or cases, or a particular person or case.\nClause 51 amends section 92E (Remission of tax of companies for years of assessment 2016 and 2017) to increase the rebate given to companies for the years of assessment 2016 and 2017. The rebate is 50% (instead of 30%) of the tax payable (excluding final withholding tax levied on income under section 43(3),\n(3A) and (3B)), subject to a cap of $20,000 per year of assessment.\nClause 52 amends section 93 (Repayment of tax) to provide that where the\nComptroller withholds a refund of tax pending the determination of an appeal by him or her against a decision by the Income Tax Board of Review or by a court, the interest payable for any part of the period on or after the date of publication in the\nGazette of the Income Tax (Amendment No. 3) Act 2016, on any refund amount ultimately determined to be due as a result of the appeal, is interest at the average prime lending rate of one or more Singapore financial institutions determined by the Minister for \u2014\n(a) the months of October, November and December in the year that is\n2 years before the year, for the part of the period that falls within\n1 January to 31 March of any year; and\n(b) the months of October, November and December in the previous year, for the part of the period that falls within 1 April and 31 December of any year.\nThe rate is to be rounded to the nearest 0.5% or another percentage prescribed by rules in its place.\nBy way of illustration, if the Income Tax (Amendment No. 3) Act 2016 is published on 1 December 2016, then the rate of interest on a refund that is withheld from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016, is \u2014\n(a) for the period between 1 July 2016 and 30 November 2016, the average of the prime lending rates for the months of October, November and\nDecember in the year 2015 (being the rate currently applicable to that period); and\n(b) for the remaining period, the new rate as described in paragraph (b) above.\nThe amendments made to Part XXB of the Act by clauses 53 to 56 and 58 are intended to enable Singapore to give effect to the OECD Country\u2010by\u2010Country\nReporting guidance set out in \"Transfer\nPricing\nDocumentation and\nCountry\u2010by\u2010Country Reporting, Action 13: 2015 Final Report\".\nClause 53 amends section 105I (Interpretation of Part XXB) to define the terms \"country\u2010by\u2010country report\" and \"CbCR exchange agreement\". Essentially, a country\u2010by\u2010country report is a report that is provided annually by a multinational enterprise containing certain information concerning each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. A CbCR exchange agreement is a bilateral or multilateral agreement under which the Parties to the agreement agree to exchange country\u2010by\u2010country reports filed with them.\nClause 54 amends section 105J (Purpose of Part XXB) to state that one purpose of Part XXB of the Act is to enable country-by-country reports to be filed with the\nComptroller (see new subsection (1A) of section 105P).\nClause 55 amends section 105K (International tax compliance agreements) to enable the Minister to declare as an international tax compliance agreement for the purposes of Part XXB, a CbCR exchange agreement to which Singapore is a Party.\nClause 56 amends section 105L (Provision of information to Comptroller) to provide that a person who has been notified pursuant to a regulation made under the new section 105P(2)(ba), that the person need not comply with section 105L, is not a prescribed person, and another person who has been notified pursuant to that regulation to carry out the obligations of the firstmentioned person is a prescribed person. Section 105L requires a prescribed person to provide prescribed information to the Comptroller, and confers immunity on the person for providing the information.\nClause 57 amends section 105N (Power of Comptroller to obtain information) to provide that the Comptroller may only authorise an officer of the Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore (called an MAS officer) or a public accountant to obtain or assist the Comptroller in obtaining information for the purpose of fulfilling an international tax compliance agreement.\nClause 58 amends section 105P (Regulations to implement international tax compliance agreements) to enable regulations to be made to enable the\nComptroller to obtain a country\u2010by\u2010country report of a multinational enterprise in a case where a tax authority of a country fails to provide such a report to the\nComptroller. The section is further amended to enable the Comptroller, after taking into account prescribed factors, to give notice to a person that the person need not comply with the obligations of a prescribed person (including the duty to give information to the Comptroller under section 105L), and to give notice to another person to discharge those duties in place of the firstmentioned person.\nClause 59 repeals various provisions of the principal Act which are no longer used, and makes consequential amendments to other provisions of the Act as a result of the repeal.\nClause 60 makes amendments to various provisions in the Act that are consequential on the amendments to sections 13H and 43, and the enactment of the new section 14Z.\nClause 61 makes an amendment to the definition of \"concessionary income\" in section 66 of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, that is consequential on the repeal of obsolete provisions of the Income Tax Act by clause 59.\nClause 62 amends the Goods and Services Tax Act \u2014\n(a) to enhance the punishment for the offence under section 66 of hindering or obstructing the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax or an officer in performing his or her duties in discharging his or her duties under the\nAct;\n(b) to enable the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax or an authorised officer, when exercising any of his or her powers on any premises under section 84, to require a person on those premises to answer questions or to produce documents for inspection;\n(c) to enable the Comptroller to give notice to a person to attend before the\nComptroller or an authorised officer to answer questions or produce documents for inspection;\n(d) to criminalise the failure to comply with a notice or requirement of the\nComptroller or an authorised officer given in exercise of his or her powers under section 84, or to provide information in response to a demand of the Comptroller or an authorised officer when in attendance pursuant to a notice under paragraph (c); and\n(e) to criminalise the giving of false information in response to a notice, requirement or demand mentioned in paragraph (d).\nThese amendments are broadly similar to the amendments made to sections 65B and 65C of the Income Tax Act and are for the same purposes.\nClause 63 makes amendments to the Stamp Duties Act (Cap. 312) that are related to the amendments made to section 37L of the Income Tax Act. The amendments increase to $80,000 the total relief allowed per financial year to a company for share acquisitions. The increased relief applies if the only \"anchor acquisitions\" in a financial year are those in subsection (5) that are made on or after\n1 April 2016 (new section 15A(8CA) and (8CB)).\nThe amendments also adjust the amount of relief that may be given to a company in the following scenarios, to take into account the increased amount:\n(a) if the acquisitions in its financial year \u2014\n(i) include an \"anchor acquisition\" in section 15A(3); and\n(ii) include an \"anchor acquisition\" in section 15A(5) whenever made;\n(b) if the acquisitions in its financial year \u2014\n(i) include an \"anchor acquisition\" in section 15A(5) made before\n(ii) include an \"anchor acquisition\" in section 15A(5) made on or after that date; and\n(iii) exclude an \"anchor acquisition\" in section 15A(3).\nClause 63 also makes other amendments to the Stamp Duties Act that are similar in nature to the amendments made to sections 65B and 65C of the Income Tax Act.\nThese amendments include the following:\n(a) to enhance the punishment for the offences under section 65 of the\nStamp Duties Act for alignment with the punishments in section 65C(1) and (8) of the Income Tax Act;\n(b) to enable the Commissioner of Stamp Duties to give notice to a person to attend before the Commissioner or an authorised officer to answer questions or produce documents for inspection;\n(c) to enable the Commissioner, when exercising any of his or her powers in relation to any premises, to require a person on those premises to answer questions or to produce documents for inspection;\n(d) to criminalise the failure to comply with a notice or requirement of the\nCommissioner given in exercise of his or her powers under the amended section 70C of the Stamp Duties Act, or to provide information in response to a demand of the Commissioner or an officer when in attendance pursuant to a notice under paragraph (b).\nClause 64 is a savings provision for the amendments made to section 18C (Initial and annual allowances for certain buildings and structures) by the Bill. It provides that an application for an allowance under that section that has a single user and a single trade for 80% of the total floor area of the building or structure on completion of the construction or renovation, is treated as an application made before 25 March 2016. It also enables the Minister to make regulations to prescribe additional savings and transitional provisions for the purposes of the amendments in the Bill.\nThis Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.",

The definition of \"library materials\" is also expanded to cover online material made available on a Singapore website.\nAs a result, the definition of \"published in Singapore\" is amended to include electronic forms. However, this definition does not apply to online material as the inclusion of online material in the collection of library materials is not determined by whether it is published in Singapore.\nTo support web\u2010harvesting, a new definition of \"online material\" is inserted, referring to material on websites that are available generally to the public. This refers to open websites and not subscription\u2010based or restricted websites. A new definition of \"Singapore website\" is also inserted. This refers to websites with the \".sg\" domain, and any other website associated with Singapore that is prescribed by the Board.\nClause 3 amends section 7(2) to empower the Board to make copies of online material made available on Singapore websites.\nClause 4 amends section 10 to provide for the obligation of legal deposit to apply to the electronic forms of library materials, and to clarify that the obligation does not apply to online material. The Board will make copies of online material on its own initiative and in the exercise of its powers under the Act.\nClause 4 also clarifies that the power of the Board to make regulations for the purposes of section 10 is to be exercised with the approval of the Minister.\nAn amendment is made to delete section 10(4) which relates to compounding the offence under that section, as a general composition provision is inserted by clause 6.\nClause 5 clarifies that the power of the Board to make regulations for the purposes of section 11 is to be exercised with the approval of the Minister.\nClause 6 inserts a new composition provision (new section 33A) to allow the chief executive officer and specifically authorised officers or employees of the\nBoard to compound any offence under the Act that is prescribed by the Board as a compoundable offence. All composition sums are to be paid into the Consolidated\nFund. Officers and employees of the Board collecting such sums are deemed to be public officers for the purposes of the Financial Procedure Act (Cap. 109) by virtue of section 21 of the Public Sector (Governance) Act 2018 (Act 5 of 2018).\nClause 7 makes an editorial amendment to section 35(2)(g) to clarify that the charges for damage, loss or late return of borrowed library materials are not \"fines\" in the sense of court fines.\nClause 8 makes consequential and related amendments to the Copyright Act.\nNew definitions are added to section 7 of the Copyright Act for \"National\nLibrary Board\", \"online material\" and \"Singapore website\" to support the consequential and related amendments.\nSection 45(7A) of the Copyright Act, which relates to making available articles in periodical publications and published works in electronic form within the library or archive premises, is amended to include online material on Singapore websites acquired by the Board. The online material can be made available to users of the library or archives in the same manner as the articles and published works, and with the same restrictions as to copying and communication.\nThe clause also inserts a new section 49A to the Copyright Act to provide that copyright in work that is or is part of online material on Singapore websites (within the meaning of the National Library Board Act) is not infringed by the Board making a copy of the online material for the purposes of acquiring and maintaining a comprehensive library collection relevant to Singapore and its people. A consequential amendment is made to section 116 of the Copyright Act resulting from the new section 49A.\nA similar provision is inserted in the new section 113A of the Copyright Act in relation to subject matter other than works. The new section allows the Board to copy cinematograph films and sound recordings that may be online material on a\nSingapore website, without infringing the copyright in the cinematograph film or sound recording.\nA new section 113B is inserted to allow libraries and archives to make available cinematograph films or sound recordings, including online material copied by the\nBoard, to users within the library and archive premises, with the same restrictions as to copying and communication as for works.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

However, in the case of water that is not for human consumption, the Board may decline to supply the water or to provide the full supply to any premises where it is impracticable or uneconomical to do so.\nClause 7 amends section 24 to allow the employees, agents or contractors of the\nBoard greater flexibility as to the time when they may enter upon premises. For instance, in the case of certain industrial or commercial premises or public streets, it may be more reasonable to carry out surveys, inspections or works at night or at a time agreed with the owner or occupier of the premises, rather than in the day.\nClause 8 inserts new sections 24A and 24B.\nThe new section 24A expressly empowers the Board to enter premises to lay pipes and other installations and water installations, to repair or replace them, and to carry out other works requisite for or incidental thereto.

Reasonable compensation is to be paid to the owner of the premises if there is any damage done to the premises in laying the pipes.\nThe new section 24B empowers the Board to act immediately in certain cases of emergency, notwithstanding other provisions for the giving of advance notice.\nClause 9 makes a consequential amendment to section 25(1) following the insertion of the new section 20(4) vide clause 5.\nClause 10 amends section 27 to insert additional grounds on which the supply of water may be stopped or interrupted by the Board, that is, if the water quality falls below the required standard or if repairs are required to any installation or water installation, which may include a water treatment plant or water production plant.\nClause 11 makes amendments to section 31 similar to that in section 24 to allow the employees, agents or contractors of the Board greater flexibility as to the time when they may enter upon premises.\nClause 12 amends section 32(2) to align the provision on compensation for consistency within the Act.\nClause 13 makes a consequential amendment to section 35 following the insertion of the new section 20(4) vide clause 5.\nClause 14 amends section 40 to delete the provision on vicarious liability as a consequential amendment to the insertion of the new section 56A vide clause 22.\nClause 15 amends section 45(2) to give the Board flexibility as to the frequency with which the inspection and maintenance of any water service installation is required to be carried out.\nClause 16 amends section 47 to make it an offence for a person to remove, destroy or damage any property of the Board, whether wilfully or otherwise, unless the person had taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid doing so.\nThe Board may either give the person in default a notice to restore the property to its original condition or replace it, or may itself restore or replace the property and recover the cost of doing so from the person in default. The person in default refers to the person who removed, destroyed or damaged the property, or the principal or employer vicariously liable for the act of his agent or employee.\nClause 17 inserts a new section 47A to create enhanced penalties for the removal, destruction or damage of certain key infrastructure, such as water mains, particularly the larger water mains, and installations or water installations, which may include water treatment plants or water production plants. Similar to section 47, the Board may either give the person in default a notice to restore the water main, installation or water installation to its original condition or replace it, or may itself restore or replace the property and recover the cost of doing so from the person in default. The person in\ndefault refers to the person who removed, destroyed or damaged the property, or the principal or employer vicariously liable for the act of his agent or employee.\nClause 18 amends section 50 to remove the element of wilfulness in the offence of interfering with or disrupting the supply of water by the Board, and to introduce the defence of having taken all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.\nClause 19 repeals and re-enacts section 51 to extend the offence of obstructing an employee, an agent or a contractor of the Board in the performance of his duty under the Act to obstructing also an authorised officer or other person authorised by the\nBoard.\nClause 20 amends section 55 to allow a person authorised by the Board, such as an auxiliary police officer, to carry out certain enforcement powers in relation to asking for a person's identity.\nClause 21 inserts 2 new sections to confer enforcement powers on authorised officers.\nThe new section 55A empowers authorised officers to require the attendance of any person acquainted with the facts and circumstances of a case, and to question and record statements from him.\nThe new section 55B empowers authorised officers to exercise certain powers of investigation, such as entering and searching premises, taking documents, samples and photographs, etc.\nClause 22 inserts a new section 56A to make a principal or an employer liable for an offence committed by his agent or employee, unless the principal or employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that the offence was committed without his consent or connivance and was not attributable to any neglect on his part. This provision previously applied only in relation to section 40 (Licensing of water service worker) and is now applicable generally to all offences under the Act.\nClause 23 repeals and re-enacts section 57 to specify in more detail the enquiries required to be made before commencing any excavation, and to provide for copies of the relevant plans and records to be obtained upon payment of a prescribed fee.\nClause 24 amends section 67 to clarify that the rights in any property of the Board (such as fixtures or fittings), whether affixed by the Board to premises or pre-existing on the premises and later acquired by the Board, do not vest in the owner of the premises and are not transferred when the rights to the premises are transferred.\nClause 25 inserts a new section 68A to provide for the Magistrate's Court or the\nDistrict Court to summarily determine any dispute as to compensation, damages, fees, costs or expenses payable under the Act. A similar provision is found in section 48 of the Sewerage and Drainage Act.\nClause 26 amends section 72(2) to allow the Minister to make regulations to give effect to the new function of the Board in relation to the regulation of activities in and around reservoirs and waterways.\nClause 27 amends the Second Schedule to delete paragraph 1 as a consequential amendment since the power to lay pipes has been set out in new section 24A.\nClause 28 provides for the validation as a tax of certain amounts collected or due for collection under section 72(1) of the Sewerage and Drainage Act, the repealed section 32(1) of the Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act (Cap. 348, 1985 Ed.) or the repealed section 51(2) of the Local Government Integration Act (Cap. 210, 1970 Ed.).\nClause 29 provides for savings or transitional provisions to be prescribed by the\nMinister.\nThis Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.",

The term \"Legal Service Officer\" is used to describe an officer in the Singapore Legal Service.\nThe term \"relevant legal officer\" is used, in the re-enacted sections 13 and 14 (to be inserted by clause 7) and the amended sections 75C(1)(c) and 75D(1)(b) (by clause 13(d)), to refer to a Legal Service Officer or a legal officer of such statutory body or law office in the public service as the Minister may prescribe by rules published in the\nGazette.\nClause 2(c) amends section 2(1) by introducing new definitions for \"practice training contract\" and \"practice training period\" to provide for the replacement of the period of pupillage with a practice training period (by clauses 6(a) and 7). The term \"practice training period\" refers to the period during which a qualified person is required to receive supervised training in relation to the practice of Singapore law before he can be admitted as an advocate and solicitor. The term \"practice training contract\" refers to a formal training arrangement between a qualified person and a\nSingapore law practice, pursuant to which the qualified person receives, and the\nSingapore law practice provides, supervised training in relation to the practice of\nSingapore law.\nClause 2(d) and (e) amends the definition of \"qualified person\" in section 2(1) to provide for \u2014\n(a) the repeal of section 7 (by clause 5), which removes the power of the Board to approve certain persons as qualified persons; and\n(b) the insertion of the new section 15A(1) (by clause 9), which empowers the\nMinister to approve certain persons as qualified persons.\nClause 3 deletes and substitutes section 4(c) as a consequence of the replacement of the period of pupillage with a practice training period (by clauses 6(a) and 7).\nClause 4 deletes and substitutes section 5(4)(b) to (f) \u2014\n(a) to make changes that are consequential to the replacement of the period of pupillage with a practice training period (by clauses 6(a) and 7), or that are technical in nature; and\n(b) to remove the Board's power to make rules exempting qualified persons from courses of instruction or examinations, as that power will be transferred to the Minister to be exercised by him under the new section 15A (to be inserted by clause 9).\nClause 5 repeals section 7, as the Board's power to approve certain persons as qualified persons will be transferred to the Minister to be exercised by him under the new section 15A(1) (to be inserted by clause 9).\nClause 6(a) deletes and substitutes section 12(1)(c) to require a qualified person to serve a practice training period in place of a period of pupillage.\nClause 6(a) and (b) also makes amendments to section 12(1) that are consequential to the deletion and substitution of section 12(2) (by clause 6(c)) and the enactment of the new section 15A (by clause 9).\nClause 6(c) deletes and substitutes section 12(2) to remove the Board's power to administratively exempt a qualified person from attending such courses of instruction and passing such examinations as may be prescribed by the Board, as that power will be transferred to the Minister to be exercised by him under the new section 15A (to be inserted by clause 9).\nClause 7 repeals and re-enacts sections 13 and 14 to provide for \u2014\n(a) the manner in which a qualified person is to serve his practice training period; and\n(b) how any period of pupillage served by a qualified person before the date of commencement of that clause is to be treated, on and after that date, for the purposes of his practice training period.\nA qualified person is required to serve his practice training period under a practice training contract with a Singapore law practice, through working as a Legal Service\nOfficer or under the supervision of a relevant legal officer who satisfies certain requirements, or through a combination of practice training contracts or such working experience or both.
